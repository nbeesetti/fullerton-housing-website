{"videoId":"DktwbunEP8k","combinedText":"all right good afternoon everyone thank you so much uh for joining us for this panel on the newly passed legislation s sp4 which makes uh housing on church and nonprofit college campuses uh an option a byright option so that we excuse me no longer have to beg at city council for permission to build more housing and that is always a good thing so i&amp;#39;m really excited to introduce to you our two panelists uh mi mangi from inner city law center who was the bill sponsor one of one of a couple of partner bill sponsors on this piece of legislation and also alexa wasburn from the nonprofit affordable housing developer national community renaissance or national core which has a long history of building affordable housing on church land uh institutional knowledge and recent experience from orange county that we are really excited to share with you today i am looking at this as continuing to plant the seeds of what is possible um we&amp;#39;ve done two other webinars about housing on church land which you can find on our youtube channel um i called them yig part one and two and i will probably end up building this one as yby part three yes in god&amp;#39;s backyard so with that i&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead and turn it over to mati who is going to start us off with an overview of the bill mati take it away go ahead i will stop sharing my screen so that you can start sorry for a second have you miss matthew meni the director of public policy for inner city law center and we were really proud to co-sponsor uh senate bill 4 along with our partners at scamp the housing association our he developers and nph northern california association of nonprofit health developers and with the southern california and northern california council of carpenters uh and so really excited to talk today a little bit about senate bill 4 and some of the stuff it does let&amp;#39;s see if i can share screen here um okay this this here and let&amp;#39;s see so see this yes okay very good well let&amp;#39;s jump right in it um you know we&amp;#39;re all very familiar with of the problem we&amp;#39;re trying to solve here we have the massive shortage of housing it is resulted in a massive homelessness crisis a massive housing affordability crisis uh resulting in you know inability of folks to access um homes inability to you know it&amp;#39;s causing problems to the economy uh and inner city law center and you know say most folks in the housing sector believe an affordable housing sector believe that we we need to significantly increase production of affordable housing uh if we want to sign if we want to you know seriously address homelessness we really want to tackle the various housing problems that we&amp;#39;re facing in our state so um we know that the two biggest barriers for the production of affordable housing are funding and land use restrictions that that prohibit residental density advate for affordable housing development senate bill for does not address the funding piece which arguably is the biggest piece but it does uh tackle the second problem which is line use that make it very difficult to to build affordable housing um so cill for what does it do it creates a streamlined process for religious organizations and nonprofit colleges and universities to develop affordable housing on their property regardless of local zoning restrictions there&amp;#39;s a lot of limitations to that and i&amp;#39;ll be going through them um but that&amp;#39;s the broad aspect uh if it is found that a property that um that that that after going through all the restrictions add one cavey there that a project uh does not comply with um objective standards uh localities have to respond within 60 days for projects that are less than 150 units and within 90 days for projects that are uh above uh above 150 units so really creates those strict timelines for localities to respond another important aspect here all projects are um subject to density bonus law and so all the waivers um that you can get an density bonus law you&amp;#39;d be able to get under senate bill 4 um with the limitations that i will note um so senate bill 4 applies to projects that are 100% affordable at 80% ami to low income household there is a possibility if if developer would like to to set aside 20% for moderate income household that&amp;#39;s 100% ami and then 5% of the units may be set aside for staff of the religious organization or the nonprofit college of university university the project requires a minimum of one off street parking spaces per unit unless uh it&amp;#39;s an a1481 1401 zone so within half hour half mile of transit um also uh if it&amp;#39;s within one block of a car share this uh this one off street parking requirement doesn&amp;#39;t apply so that that that&amp;#39;s really interesting i think that&amp;#39;s the expansion um projects to have to be partnership between the land owner and nonprofit housing builder the specific specification in the law is that the land must be owned by a applicable religious organization or nonprofit college university before january 1st 2024 uh it doesn&amp;#39;t specify whether the uh sort of nonprofit college university can sell the land to the affordable hous developer lease the land to the developer rent it those are open to the negotiations between nonprofit colle universities nonprofits li organizations and the affordable housing developer that develop a project so those are all subject to negotiation and they&amp;#39;re not specified in the bill the only specification is the land must be owned by the qualified organization before january 1st 2024 and if that is the case they can uh work with any applicable affordable housing developer that&amp;#39;s willing to work with them to develop the project and then of course lastly all projects must be improved ministerially so these are byright processes they&amp;#39;re not subject to sea and there are strict timelines ality must respond to if uh if objective if they deem the project to not need objective standards um these projects only apply in urban areas they don&amp;#39;t apply in primed farmland or fire well the fire hy sorry that&amp;#39;s slightly complicated and changed um the the please disregard that paragraph there were last minute changes to the bill that i actually need to confirm um where where it applies um on that particular area um the development is can&amp;#39;t be located on on sites that would require the demolishment of affordable housing or rec controlled housing or ted occupied housing within the past 10 years so that&amp;#39;s sbt30 protections the development uh can&amp;#39;t be adjoined to any site where more than onethird of the square footage uh on the site is dedicated to light industrial use um and if the development projectes the of any existing residence units so sp230 would apply and then lastly the locality b pos objective planning standards u with documentation but they do have to respond within 60 days uh for development with less than 150 units or within 90 days for proct that are more than 100 units um this is some of the latest additions that we that we ac toate to the bill were that every project does have to conduct a phase one environmental assessment um if any uh if any any um mitigations are needed b based on the findings of the phase one environmental assessment is phase to environmental assessment it may be required so that was something that we had to do towards the end um another thing we have to add was for development is within 500 ft of a freeway uh it&amp;#39;s project still allowed but the projects have to have a internal air filtration system up to mph 13 so that&amp;#39;s a high level of air filtration to you know mitigate any um pollution from the freeways and this is very important every project must meet labor standards required into ab 2011 so these are paying prevailing wages um and if it&amp;#39;s projects that are more than 50 uh units prevailing wages plus healthare is required um and in addition uh some efforts may must be required to seek apprenticeship so this is not a skilled and trained it is prevailing wage but there is a written a law that efforts must be made to to seek contractors who use apprentices uh and there&amp;#39;s a recogition that if those those apprenticeship are not found um then the developer can move forward with with just a with a uh developer that that is working um or with contractors that pay prevailing wage and with projects about 50 units avil we plus healthare um the in terms of the the debt allowable density of the developments if it&amp;#39;s located in sort of these are based on the mullen densities these are all based on the mullen density folks are familiar with it um so it&amp;#39;s 15 units per acre we&amp;#39;re an incorporated city didn&amp;#39;t not maron county deer if it&amp;#39;s in a residential area uh for non-corporate area it&amp;#39;s 10 years per acre for suburban jurisdiction 20 years per acre and for jurisdiction in the metropolitan county 30 units per acre so um really for most cities this would be around 30 units per acre so not the highest level of density not the lowest level of density the moderate level of density um uh good thing is if the project is located in a zone that doesn&amp;#39;t allow residental use actually has a higher allowable density 40 units per acre plus one unit one story above the maximum height um so so this is this is a this is something that that that so for areas that are not zoned for residental uses it can allow for a higher um density um so locality allows for uh again a greater residential density than that applies so it wouldn&amp;#39;t be limited to this level if there&amp;#39;s a higher density allowable by the locality then the higher density or building liit would apply um so all i said this before but all the land that that that could use for development has to be owned by an independent institution of higher education or a religious institution onor before january 1st 2024 um that that that&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;s currently written in the bill so you know there there&amp;#39;s still i guess couple more months than 15 days for institution acquire this land but after that this window will be closed um this it&amp;#39;s war but but but but those some changes if it&amp;#39;s within um the the property that is to be developed can&amp;#39;t be adjoined to any site that&amp;#39;s more than one-third light industrial it also can&amp;#39;t uh so sorry um it also can&amp;#39;t be uh within 1,200 ft of a site that is heavy industri and then it can&amp;#39;t be located 1600 ft from a site that is currently a tidle v industrial use um tile v industrial uses are relatively high they&amp;#39;re classified as um sites that have high level of nuisance and whatnot tend to be like incinerators garbage dumps um they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re not the most common in the world but but they they are they do exist i i have a link here sort of of sites that that require to get a title v operating permit um and so no no site can be located 1600 feet within one of these sites hey mty yes we we had a quick um we had a request uh a lot of this information is kind of highly technical and and probably new to some of our audience members so we just had a request if you could just slow down a little bit oh apology no problem thank you so much and i&amp;#39;m going through this but but i&amp;#39;m gonna make to answer any question we can go back to any of this sl yes if you have questions sorry if anyone has questions feel free to put them in the chat and we will um we&amp;#39;ll have time for q&amp;amp;a at the end i&amp;#39;ll go over this again so this is it&amp;#39;s somewhat tiered um can be adjoined to any site that to can&amp;#39;t be ad join to any site that is industrial and that&amp;#39;s defined as a site that&amp;#39;s more than one3 industrial can&amp;#39;t be uh 1200 uh can&amp;#39;t be within 1200 ft of a site that is heavy industrial it can&amp;#39;t be, 1600 feet from a site that is um a tital v site and then it can&amp;#39;t be 30 within 3200 feet of an existing facility that extracts natural gas refin oil this is an existing active facility so it&amp;#39;s the previously active facility that is currently dormant this restriction does not apply um c has some great maps i&amp;#39;ll see if i can to share this um towards the end about what sites are excluded this is probably the biggest exclusion especially in the la county area we have a lot of oil wells along the coast in orange county and hunton beach your belinda brea and then in the englewood basin area including englewood south bay torren so this is probably the biggest restriction in here um and it does limit many many sites that are on residential and non-residential areas let me check the chat real quick if you can pause between that would be great um yes i will pause maria did you have a question oh thank you now i was saying pausing and between your points allows us for us to take it in better thank you apologies apologies i have to talk back i will do that thank you so much does anybody have i&amp;#39;m just gonna ask i&amp;#39;m gonna stop here do anybody here would anybody like me to go back a couple slides or um review any material yes i would be grateful if you&amp;#39;d back up a few slides and then just let us look one more time because you that was a lot of information about the restrictions okay so this is these are about the density the maximum allowable density on non on on non-residential sites is 40 units per acre plus one the height of one story above the maximum otherwise in residential areas m density supply so that&amp;#39;s 15 units per acre in um basically all of orange county was fallen a 30 units breaker there&amp;#39;s any folks that are and then going back to the labor standards so we had a question about the um high fire the wooi i think wildland urban interface the high fire zone um if it&amp;#39;s okay i&amp;#39;m going to double check on that i know there was a change so after alexa goes i&amp;#39;m gonna i&amp;#39;m gonna check that real quick and i&amp;#39;ll answer that question towards the end of the call if that&amp;#39;s okay sounds great thank you so much and perhaps we could make these slides available uh in the updated form and we could send it out to everyone who registered definitely i will awesome thank you so much um okay so just go back slight yeah i&amp;#39;m just g to go back here a little little bit more cover this one more time and then i&amp;#39;ll move forward and try to make try to go a little bit slower apologies um so again these are appliable applicable in urban area i&amp;#39;m g go back after alexa and double check the the high fire very high fires theity zones um again sp230 protection supp and all projects must conduct the phase one environmental assessment and if they&amp;#39;re located within 500 fet of a freeway um they&amp;#39;re still allowable but the inter the the internal areas of the of the project would require a m 13 filter and my uh question and you might already you might be covering this i might be jumping ahead but um we&amp;#39;re uh projects are also still required to go through tribal consultation correct so i think if something is found in the phase one enviral review that needs mitigated in terms of tribal resources then they would okay um but but but otherwise they they may not happen so so really it&amp;#39;s only if something is found that needs to be mitigated right okay so going back here um land has to be owned by institutions rious organizations or churches universities before january 1 2024 and then there&amp;#39;s the rubric of of depending on the type of industrial site there&amp;#39;s various z of raining from 12200 feet, 1500 feet and 3200 feet the highest for active natural gap and oil refin oil um drilling facilities or refining facilities um that&amp;#39;s mostly the technical aspect of the build these are sponsors nph scam carpenters in law center jpac the public affairs committee of california and uh supported also by you know many nonprofit organizations in the organizations um we&amp;#39;re happy that happy that we&amp;#39;re able to get this law through um and that&amp;#39;s pretty much the technical aspect of of the bill but gonna open any question well i&amp;#39;ll just address a couple of questions i saw um one was to uh explain what squa stands for cqa california environmental quality act which has been both a a a blessing in helping us preserve our environment but has also been uh very challenging when it comes to uh getting housing built because a lot of times uh opponents of new development will use that to slow down and or kill the project so that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where sql comes from and that&amp;#39;s why having a project be quote unquote by right um basically means that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s the local government no longer has the ability to just say no out of hand that the it&amp;#39;s almost as though the the state is saying okay this project now complies with your zoning and um it&amp;#39;s no longer what&amp;#39;s called a discretionary uh and a discretionary action meaning the city council has to basically bless your ability to build it um and so another reason that that is very uh helpful is because um we hear a lot from uh local elected officials who know that we need a housing uh known that we need more housing in our communities perhaps are even inclined that way themselves but it&amp;#39;s very challenging against when they&amp;#39;re faced with a lot of opposition uh from from their constituents and so having a project be by right uh kind of takes that question out it&amp;#39;s not if this housing is going to happen it&amp;#39;s that it&amp;#39;s going to happen and how can i as an elected official help shape that project so that it&amp;#39;s a good fit for my community um so it sort of helps us over that hurle of of production um and helping us get to yes and and shaping a project to fit a community rather than just saying no this project can&amp;#39;t happen in this community um yeah i&amp;#39;ll also add because of density bonus law and because of the maximum density requirements in this build what this means is if you build a project that is um sort at the applicable density uh you can and and because these are 100% affordable project you can combine this with density bonus law and requests for as many waivers that are allowable under density bonus law to objective standards uh to make the project allowable as long as they fall under the appropriate densities so that that does allow for a flexible a degree of flexibility when when when when putting a project together and mon does are these projects ex exempted from squa they are exempt from squa they do have to do a f environmental review they do have to do phase one environmental review they&amp;#39;re just considered not a project under squ okay which has its own technical yeah i know right techn yeah it&amp;#39;s not technically creating exemption if equ was to defining it is not a project so then it&amp;#39;s not like that so it&amp;#39;s not subject sequence so that&amp;#39;s the same as 2011 it&amp;#39;s not crazy technically it&amp;#39;s not an exemption if equ it is a defining it as not a project not a project okay i think our friend betsy has a question bety go ahead to unmute myself okay thanks um the in the material you provided i got confused about there there were things that can be done with units with buildings that are 50 units or more and things that can&amp;#39;t in particular i think you said that uh if it&amp;#39;s in a residential area it can only be 40 units is that right no so so i&amp;#39;m going to go back to that that&amp;#39;s referring to the density per acre yeah okay um let me see if i can go back to those slides here you go so this is referring to the density per acre not the unit limit okay yeah so same more um so density per acre is kind of like a metric that&amp;#39;s used to usually it&amp;#39;s like when we&amp;#39;re defining density so let&amp;#39;s say half an acre the when you say density per acre of 30 units that means that you can build up to 15 units on that parcel and so this is basically overriding local zoning and creating so essentially it&amp;#39;s like zoning at the statewide level so there was a break though between 40 units there was i wrote down 40 units one story ifin a residential area so there it is so the 30 unit limit of appes to i would say nearly every part of orange county uh in residential zon right unit per acre applies in non-residential z so this is say a plot that&amp;#39;s owned by a religious organization or nonprofit colge university it might be zone commercial um okay and so even if residential use is not allowed under zoning f4 does two things first it says residental use is now allowed and the maximum density is now 40 units per acre got it thank you very much and then uh is prevailing wage required in all cases or only in cases of 50 units or more fing wages are required in all cases okay that are under and it&amp;#39;s health so it&amp;#39;s prevailing wage and health care for 50 units or more yes okay thank you and then we have a question from david who&amp;#39;s asking about the density of 40 units per acre is that the base density i think he&amp;#39;s referring to like before the uh density bonus i don&amp;#39;t know the answer to the question but alexa is nodded you want to think yeah yes so your so that&amp;#39;s your you can it allows 40 dwelling units per acre that&amp;#39;s in the non-residential zones and you can utilize density bonus on top of that okay thank you that appreciate that so then in a residential zone with the 30 dwelling unit per acre you can use density bonus on top of that too yes okay awesome all right um i think with that i&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead and let uh alexa get started let me i&amp;#39;m running slides for her so let me go to those slides yes no problem well good afternoon everybody um again my name is alexa wasburn i am a senior vice president president of planning and acquisitions for national community renaissance and most people know us as national core or core for short and i appreciate the opportunity to join the conversation today um as elizabeth said we&amp;#39;ve been partnering with churches to provide affordable housing i say probably for about eight years now i think you know some of the projects i&amp;#39;m going to highlight go back to 2017 and so we are very very excited that senate bill forth pass but i look at it as senate bill 4 is another tool right that we have in our toolbox and i always say you know like your toolbox you don&amp;#39;t use every tool on every single project and so um you know not every site&amp;#39;s going to qualify qualify for senate bill 4 and we&amp;#39;re not necessarily going to use senate bill 4 on every church projects because there&amp;#39;s a number of considerations that we need to weigh so what i want to do this afternoon is uh share a couple of projects with you that are either completed or under construction and so these that so senate bill 4 was not in place at the time and so these are case studies that allow me to look back right we can look back on them and say how would have senate bill 4 helped us with these projects what are some considerations uh for use of senate bill 4 and then hopefully i can inspire the folks that are joining us today on what is possible on church land and on on um college land as well so next slide please so i always have to do a little plug but also give you some context as to national core um we are a nonprofit community development organization and we specialize in build building and managing high quality affordable housing paired with best practice supportive services and we&amp;#39;ve been doing this for over 30 years and uh we own and operate over 10,000 units of affordable housing and 8 500 of those are right here in uh southern california i think what makes us unique is we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re inhouse fully integrated um so we not only develop we build and we manage um and then we also provide services at each of our at each of our properties so next slide so for national core and our church partners um there&amp;#39;s are a number of benefits that we see to our partnership and first and foremost our partnership has created an opportunity for everyone to further our shared mission right we have a common goal of serving others and helping our most vulnerable populations from our frail seniors to our families to transitional age youth and the homeless and so having that shared mission really um helps advance our partnership and makes it a nice fit to do affordable housing on church land i think it also creates an opportunity for affordable housing developments to serve as a catalyst right a catalyst to revitalize or um underutilize land and you know we&amp;#39;re investing millions of dollars into these affordable housing development sometimes you know additional infrastructure upgrades depending on the funding sources that we&amp;#39;re bringing into the deal it could be also parks and transit amenities as well so this creates an opportunity to uplift an entire neighborhood thirdly uh churches many of them are located in stable residential neighborhoods that qualify as high resource and high resource is a priority area for certain funding sources uh in california and through our low-income housing tax credit program and then also we can structure the transaction to meet the needs of both parties so if the church is long-term goal is they need a long-term revenue stream um we will often enter into a long-term ground lease right and they receive the annual rent payments and that they can use that towards maintenance or upgrades or operations of their church there&amp;#39;s other churches that may just need a one-time payment some upfront cash and um so we&amp;#39;ll acquire the land and maybe there&amp;#39;s a balloon payment so you know each each transaction is unique and it gives us the ability to um to structure that transaction to meet our goals as well as our church partners goals and um i always say the affordable housing process it&amp;#39;s really sort of a puzzle and thankfully for these projects we&amp;#39;ve being able to figure out how to fit most of the pieces together next slide please so as i said you we&amp;#39;ve had several church pro uh partnership projects that uh recently compl completed in orange county as well as a few that are underway and with various fates and denominations you can see here and i&amp;#39;d say well each is unique there are essentially two types of development we have development where the church is going to continue to operate on the site and we nestle those affordable housing buildings on site around the church or adjacent to the church and we have other instances where the church will own excess land that&amp;#39;s either vacant or um there&amp;#39;s buildings on it but they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re not going to continue to operate a church there it just may be land that the church owns so what i want to do is share our experience with two church partnership projects in orange county um in the city of placenta as well as buena park and both of these are partnership projects with the episcopal dicese of los angeles so next slide please the first development i want to talk about is is santa angelina this is our senior apartment home community in the city of placentia and it&amp;#39;s a partnership project between national corp and blessed sacrament episcopal church and then the episcopal dicese of la and gosh this project was initiated in 2017 when the dases expressed interest in exploring the possibility of affordable housing on this local church site and so the blessed sacrament church it&amp;#39;s located at 1314 north angelina drive this is at the northeast corner of the intersection of angelina drive in morse avenue and if you guys are familiar with northern orange county the major cross streets are yor belinda boulevard and crer and the entire church campus is about 3.9 acres in its one contiguous rectangular shaped parcel the church is centrally located in the center of the site with a large surface parking lot located on the southern half fronting morse and then the c the church they currently operate out of three buildings there&amp;#39;s the main sanctuary there&amp;#39;s a parish hall that&amp;#39;s adjacent to the sanctuary and then they operate a preschool that&amp;#39;s in the back and so the northern and southeastern portions of the church campus were undeveloped um underutilized uh there was some landscaping with trees and i&amp;#39;d say grass that was mostly dead for for a large part of the year unless we we got some rain and you know thinking about the various funding sources to utilize for affordable housing we really liked this site because it was fairly walkable a 77 walk score in north orange county is actually pretty good it&amp;#39;s it means it&amp;#39;s fairly walkable it has good access to amenities which are not only needed for our residents but also to have a competitive application um so you see here the site context it&amp;#39;s across the street from retail and services and then behind it kind of nestled around it are is a single family residential neighborhood right next slide please so we are currently developing a senior affordable community with 65 apartment homes there&amp;#39;s 58 one-bedroom units six two-bedroom units and one studio and the density for this development is 16.7 dwelling units per acre so keep in mind that senate bill four would allow 30 ding units per acre on this site and while we are building a two-story building senate bill four would have allowed three stories and maybe additionally more if we were to utilize density bonus you can see here that the church uh remains the center of the of of the site that was very important to the congregation that the church still remain the focal point and then we are currently constructing two buildings one on either side to really create an interconnected campus and the residential development it&amp;#39;ll include a variety of amenities we&amp;#39;ve got a um community room that we will provide services for our seniors community gardens there&amp;#39;s an outdoor fireplace area and seating areas and so in order to build these apartment homes we had to demolish the existing parish all and reconstru construct a new parish hall oriented in a different way um as well as a memorial courtyard for the church i want to talk about parking a little bit um there were 85 existing parking spaces for the church we&amp;#39;re adding 45 spaces for the residential unit so there&amp;#39;s going to be a total of 130 spaces and the approved parking ratio for the residential units is7 spaces per unit so again i want you to note that that parking is under the requirement of the minimum one space per unit for senate bill four okay what and i&amp;#39;m going to talk a little bit later about parking next slide here&amp;#39;s a view um this is a rendering of building one at the north end of the property and it just shows how the new residential units are going to interface with the new church parish hall next slide and this view shows building two that&amp;#39;s the southern end of the property facing the single family homes across mo street and i just i want to draw your attention to the scale and the architecture of the buildings because this was carefully designed to be complementary to the existing church so you see that we carry over a lot of the architectural design elements and to be compatible with the single family neighborhood and next slide and as i said santa angelina will consist of 64 affordable units uh for households that earn less than 60% of the area median income and 21 of those units are set aside as permanent supportive housing okay those are that&amp;#39;s apartment homes for individuals that either are experiencing homelessness or are at risk of experiencing homelessness and then there would be one exempt on-site manager unit um that&amp;#39;s not income restricted so we always have a manager that lives onsite and each of our communities all right next slide so the second development that i want to highlight is called orchard view gardens senior apartment home community and it&amp;#39;s in the city of bua park and this is a partnership project between national corp st joseph&amp;#39;s episcopal church and the episcopal dases of la and this project was initiated back in 2018 um after core after we started work on the santa angelina development in placentia we had another another church within the la dases that raised their hands and say hey you know we&amp;#39;re interested in exploring affordable housing too and so they connected us with them next slide so this project&amp;#39;s located at 8300 valley view boulevard it&amp;#39;s about mid mid block uh along valley view street between la palma and crescent avenue and this is a 3.2 acre project site that is home to st joseph&amp;#39;s episcopal church you&amp;#39;ll notice that the church is located on the southern portion of the site and housed in a single building and it&amp;#39;s surrounded by surface parking and then the northern portion of the site is vacant and that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re going to nestle our apartment home community and so the project we had to subdivide the existing parcel into two parcels and the southern parcel would maintain the church and the surface parking on about 1.4 acres and then that newly created parcel is about 1.76 acres and that&amp;#39;s going to be our parcel for the senior affordable uh apartment home community and next slide so the 66 uh we&amp;#39;re proposing or this is actually under construction now is a 66 apartment homes for our seniors age 62 and better and it includes 62 one-bedroom units and four two-bedroom units and it&amp;#39;s proposed in one larger building and then we have three smaller buildings the density for this housing parcel is 37.5 dwelling units per acre so we are actually would be exceeding the s sp4 um density um that&amp;#39;s allowed that&amp;#39;s that 30 dwelling units prer but again remember with sp4 we&amp;#39;re allowed to use density bonus as well so in this case that our density would be um right in there and here building one we face valley view streets it&amp;#39;s a two-story building that transitions to three stories internally and then back down to two stories and then we have nine little casitas along the property line that ab buts single family uh the single family neighborhood we also gave you know careful consideration to the character and scale um of this project as well to ensure that it was complementary to the surrounding properties and that the architecture and the massing blended in with the surrounding uses and so here the maximum building height is 35 ft um three stories uh again we placed that third story interior to the site i want to bring up parking again because this one um parking was a challenge uh the church had 121 existing parking spaces on site and in order to develop the housing we had to remove 41 spaces so we were reducing the church parking to 80 spaces but then we were adding 48 spaces for the residential unit so it resulted in a very similar parking ratio to santa angelin which was about7 spaces per unit again note that this is under the sp sp4 uh requirement next slide here we go so this is the view of building one and it shows how it looks in context with the existing church next slide and this view this shows the most dense part of the building the three stories and then how it drops to the single stories citas that run along the north property line next slide and again orchard view gardens it will consist of 65 units that are affordable to our seniors earning 60% of the area median income we do have eight of the apartment homes that are set aside as permanent support of housing psh and then again there would be one uh exempt on site manager unit all right next slide so now that i presented our two case studies i when i look back at what the challenges were and how if sp4 were in place at that time how how we could have benefited from this tool so one of the challenges that we faced with both projects i&amp;#39;d say was the complexity of the entitlements and the number of applications required to get that development the both of those developments approved so for both projects we had to go through a general plan amendment a zone change development plan review on bua park we had a parcel map a development agreement and then for both projects we had squa as well as nepa because we had vouchers um and for squa it was a mitigated neg deck negative declaration so for these projects we we started the pre-application meetings i would say in april spring of 2018 and approval happened in 2020 okay so both of these projects took two and a half to three years from our first submitt to get the project approved so with sb4 in if if sp sp4 was in placed at the time i estimate we could have gotten through the entitlement process in about six to nine months so we could have shaved off two to two and a half years from our entitlement process um which would allowed us to deliver you know units would have already been on the ground we&amp;#39;d have residents moved in there um enjoying their new homes already so right there is just shows how senate bill 4 could have streamlined this process significantly and next slide another challenge we always we face on church partnership projects is you know in trying to navigate the entitlement process the reality is is that there&amp;#39;s many different entities involved and they all have strong opinions or requirements that need to be met you&amp;#39;ve you have the church as the landowner and the visionary which for both of these projects there was the dases then the local church leadership and then the congregational members then you have city staff and the elected officials who need to ensure that the project meets city codes and the development objectives and then you have neighbors who are ultimately feel they&amp;#39;re going to be impacted in some way right by this new development that&amp;#39;s occurring near their home and then you have us the developer who&amp;#39;s trying to navigate deadlines for funding sources trying to please everybody while making sure that our b our budget doesn&amp;#39;t implode right and so with senate bill for some of these challenges go away because the projects are ministerial meaning that we wouldn&amp;#39;t have to go to planning commission or city council but i do want to emphasize that you still need to do some level of outreach right you&amp;#39;re still going to need to do outreach internally within the church to get the congregation supportive of the project and also your immediate neighbors it&amp;#39;s not and i&amp;#39;m saying that this isn&amp;#39;t required by senate bill for but this is how national corps how we would still conduct our projects using senate bill for next slide please now to highlight how how these part parties played out in placenta i wanted to share this slide with you because it shows only some only some of the outreach that was conducted for santa angelina and you can see that some of these date back to 2018 when we first started meeting with the church vri about concepts and and you can see there&amp;#39;s numerous meetings on here with the city and the dases and the vestri and the community and while you know the slide really doesn&amp;#39;t capture all of the meetings that occurred i think it gives you a picture of how extensive the outreach process can be for these types of projects and you know ultimately again the project was approved in december of 2020 and so while senate bill 4 um would rel some of these meetings right in terms of the discretionary review process i think for every project you still need to do some level of community outreach but again the streamlining from a three-year process to about six to 9 months is significant a significant benefit of senate bill 4 next slide please along with the winding road of community meetings right we have this winding road of s of site plan iterations so generally each meeting that we had there would be a series of meetings with our design team afterwards to adjust the site plan and the project plans and so you can kind of see how the building started to move around the site and the building footprint evolved over time and what i wanted to point out here is that we talked about you know senate bill for the first back to what i call the housing element default densities right so mo for most of orange county that default density is 30 dwelling units per acre and so um what&amp;#39;s interesting here is we got a lot of push back in placenta originally our buildings we proposed three stories they ultimately ended up ended up being two stories um we were able to maintain uh the original number of units that we proposed so we had an incredible design team that was able to still design the project and drop uh to two stories now again if senate bill for were in place we could have still pursued uh three stories the original design um you know and gotten that approved through the city next slide okay yeah here&amp;#39;s where i want to talk a little bit about parking because you know with every project there&amp;#39;s always concerns about traffic and parking i think this is a concern for all stakeholders you hear it from the city from the neighbors from the church and then we even we even discuss it internally here at national corp between our development and our property management um and so we&amp;#39;ve put together extensive materials on parking and parking studies and we even conduct our own internal parking studies and so i think senate bill for it is going to help with some parking challenges uh but in our case for both of these projects both the parking that is being delivered is less than one unit uh one space per unit and where senate bill for requires a minimum one space per unit so that&amp;#39;s where we you know we may not have used senate bill for if it came down to parking um but i also wanted to share a tip with you guys and that is the passage of ab1 1851 in 2020 this is another tool uh that really came before senate bill 4 and ab1 1851 reduces the number of required parking spaces on site for religious uses so what it says is if you have an existing religious use that you&amp;#39;re allowed to reduce the parking down to 50% in order to accommodate your affordable housing project okay so that&amp;#39;s something where moving forward i can still utilize s sp4 in combination with ab1 1851 to arrive at my parking right that was s spaces per unit for both placenta and buena park so that&amp;#39;s a little tip for some of the developers uh that are out there and next slide okay and this and this is the last one i just i i wanted to end by saying you know i believe senate bill 4 is an important tool to advance the production of affordable housing and in orange county and throughout the state of california now not every site&amp;#39;s going to qualify for senate bill four as mti explained right what what the qualifications and criteria are and we as a developer are not necessarily going to use senate bill for on every church project um you know for example it depends on the financing strategy because senate bill four triggers state prevailing wages which significant significantly increases the total development costs so if my capital stack doesn&amp;#39;t already have a source that triggers prevailing wages then i&amp;#39;m going to think twice about using senate bill for um so for placentia for example we already had sources in our capital stack um primarily funding from the state as well as vouchers over 21 vouchers so we were already paying state as well as federal prevailing wages so with placenta i probably would have moved forward using senate bill four now bua park on the other hand bua park we were not utilizing any sources that uh that require prevailing wages and so i would have probably not used state bill four on the buena park project because that would have added significant cost to an already difficult and challenging project to finance um so just you know from a developer&amp;#39;s point of view is they while senate b bill for i think provides um a number a tool for us you want to weigh the benefits and the consequences right of using that tool and so it may not be a fit for every project but i certainly think it&amp;#39;s an important tool to advance affordable housing so that ends yes that ends my presentation um happy to answer any questions that that you might have and again happy to give a tour of these projects placenta uh is about done we&amp;#39;re going to be having our grand opening in early 2024 so i&amp;#39;d love for you to join us and give you a tour of that project awesome thank you so much um i there&amp;#39;s a couple questions in the chat that i will go ahead and put forward um so this person says under s sp4 the church has to provide at least one parking space per unit does it mean it might be beneficial to look at other ways to build parking because parking can be pricey when the church has a small site in an urban setting yeah well so one of the tips i i would look at it a couple ways is um parking can be especially in an urban setting where you don&amp;#39;t have space right we were able for the two case studies i showed here is to provide surface parking but if you&amp;#39;re forced to go into a podium or type of structured parking one space per unit can be quite expensive and so that&amp;#39;s where i would utilize or look at using ab1 1851 to see if that tool uh could assist me in reducing below a one space per unit um also if typically in urban locations you are going to be close to transit so you also want to see if you qualify for the um for the exemptions on parking that really that if you&amp;#39;re in in close proximity within a half mile to a high quality transit station then then no parking is required um and so it&amp;#39;s you know it&amp;#39;s looking at other tools that are still available out there in your toolbox that could still help you in combination with senate bill 4 awesome and then just nodding yeah because i want to open this up to you m if you have any other yeah any only adding that also if it&amp;#39;s you know within l block of car share you also don&amp;#39;t need to have that parking so you need to look for these different opportunities to reduce the parking um you know below you know if you need that waiver below to get it below one yeah that&amp;#39;s a good idea yeah um i see leon has his hand up leon would you like to unmute and go ahead and ask your question yeah thank you this is been really helpful a lot of information and we&amp;#39;re just kind of starting to look into the implications of sb4 i&amp;#39;m with los angeles county um and i wanted to ask if you could speak to the relationship between the church and the housing operator um and specifically the one thing i&amp;#39;m not hearing is um any guard rails in place to prevent housing discrimination like for example uh people of different faiths or no faith or members of the lgbtq plus community um if you could speak to that i&amp;#39;d appreciate it thanks sure yeah so for national core we&amp;#39;re an owner operator so we also will uh provide the we will be we manage all of our apartment home communities um even our church partnership communities and so we you know these are still um projects that are heavily regulated right so we still have to abide by fair housing law and the various funding sources still require an open um process so so we still have to we still go through our regular lease up process individuals would qualify like you would at any affordable housing project right and it it you know and there&amp;#39;s different caveats depending on the various funding sources but you do not have to be um a church member or religious to live in these communities in fact we market um these as we would any of our affordable housing communities we create a weight list and we do and we conduct a lottery uh to of the various applicants to get awarded an apartment home community so we can&amp;#39;t give preference we&amp;#39;re not giving preference to the church um members does that answer okay yeah yeah absolutely thank you yeah and then we had a couple of questions earlier um but i think this one lends itself to that too um there was a a question to talk about um could you give like a profile of a church that would be a good candidate and i think they were referring to like the age of the congregation uh cash flow issues of the congregation and then kind of segways onto that is this other question um about who owns the buildings and how do they work out the ground lease i mean i think you were saying alexa every project is kind of a different uh could potentially look differently but maybe you can speak to that sure so i&amp;#39;ll start with that with the ground le question um is i would say majority of our church partnership projects are long-term ground leases um the you know the just like within city government um there is you know a governmental structure to a church right and so in this case of our episcopal church partnerships the la dases owns the land and they want to continue to own the land and so we entered into a long-term ground lease with them to lease the land for in both of these cases it&amp;#39;s a minimum 99 years um you need to do a minimum 65 years uh for teac purposes but if it&amp;#39;s hcd sources that you&amp;#39;re using it&amp;#39;s 99 anyways um so the church continues to own the land and we you know it&amp;#39;s the limited partnership that that we as a developer that owns the buildings right and that so that&amp;#39;s the way that structure works um but we do have a few cases in that slide where i showed you a number of our other church partnerships for example we have our legacy square development in santa ana um as well as our project in riverside where it it that was excess land that we were able to acquire um and then it was just like you would any any private sellers we acquired the land through a purchase and sale agreement and and you know now we own the land as well as of buildings um in terms of what would make an ideal site uh what we have seen i&amp;#39;d say primarily with our church partnerships it&amp;#39;s a win-win in that many of these churches are struggling with uh membership right with their congregational numbers they have an ing congregation um and it&amp;#39;s diminishing and so their challenge as a congregation is maintaining their property and their buildings and they don&amp;#39;t have that the revenue right coming in and so what we&amp;#39;re able to offer them is a revenue source right so through ground lease payments they&amp;#39;re receiving annual rent um and that&amp;#39;s a consistent revenue source that you know is tied um uh does have an annual or you know an increased uh based in there and so it&amp;#39;s for the length of the lease that they&amp;#39;re kind of continue to receive payments um and you know really every church property is different what we what we&amp;#39;ll do is we&amp;#39;ll go out and give an honest assessment you know look at the property itself in some cases even if you don&amp;#39;t have vacant land there may be buildings that the church uh says hey you know we don&amp;#39;t utilize these buildings you know you could demolish those to create more developable area for the affordable housing um you know and then we have we have others where it&amp;#39;s you&amp;#39;re infilling on a parking lot um it it really depends depends on the situation on the site every every site&amp;#39;s different i&amp;#39;d say we typically need at least a half acre right to to get to that scale of affordable units um that can be financed and built um yeah yeah hopefully that&amp;#39;s helpful yeah i think i think that got it what uh daniel was asking for um so the last question is uh betsy is asking to confirm that sb4 requires a nonprofit housing developer is that yes i see we see nodding from my and alexa awesome um okay we and affordable hous affordable housing director and using the technical term affordable correct yes i think he said it was 20% could be moderate at 100% ami and the rest had to be uh 80% or below ami area median income um which for orange for orange county this year is i know north of $100,000 for a family of four so you can be a a a dual income young professional uh household and still be considered low income which boggles the mind but that&amp;#39;s why we do what we did to try to build more affordable housing okay and then so i want to just respect everybody&amp;#39;s time but i just wanted to give m a chance i don&amp;#39;t know if you were able to find the high fire information yes two two points in that so fe4 does not apply in very high fire severity zone um that was that yeah so that still doesn&amp;#39;t apply we&amp;#39;re trying to change that towards the end to sort of like limit it to to broaden it to some zones but it but currently fp4 does not apply to very high priorities varity zones um second thing um that one of my colleagues here actually in the audience gor gesley with the carpenters um brought up was that sb4 labor standards don&amp;#39;t apply to projects smaller than 10 units so that that is potential for folks looking to do very small projects um you might have that so sorry linda can you please repeat so fd4 is not allowed in specifically very high fire severity zone so so if it&amp;#39;s high or medium would be fine but if it&amp;#39;s a very high fire zone f would not be applicable and mty is is the wooi synonymous with high fire is that the same thing or that&amp;#39;s not the same thing i&amp;#39;m not the wildland urban interface oh no so that&amp;#39;s a different um that&amp;#39;s a different uh mapping uh that the very high priorities of are are maps that put out by the california department of wildfire and uh department of foresty and fire protection they put that show i know somebody else asked is there like there&amp;#39;s all these restrictions is there a map that shows where this is applicable i wish that was the case and maybe that&amp;#39;s something we should really lobby hcd to do because there is all these bills ab211 f4 f43 each of them have different applicabilities yeah and that is unfortunate um it is often left of locality so i know city of los angeles every so often publishes maps i don&amp;#39;t know if other cities in orange county are doing that and i imagine they&amp;#39;re probably not but alexa can probably speak little bit more yeah i i want to say i think the turner center too is like you know they had released a a white paper on s4 before s sp4 passed but really saying hey that you know s sp4 this is the potential that it could have and increasing the supply of housing and i think now that we know right the provisions that came with s sp4 it&amp;#39;s like taking a second look and saying okay let&amp;#39;s remap this and look at the available at the land that would qualify under sb4 exactly david go ahead uh thank you uh at first this is a wonderful seminar and i must uh i lost my headphones i must apologize because um believe that you may have covered this in the beginning but am i understanding it correctly it the sbv helps with the density even if it&amp;#39;s zoned a a low density aspect the uh we have a project that&amp;#39;s zoned r1 that&amp;#39;s church owned land and in the city it that&amp;#39;s 8.7 units per acre um so it&amp;#39;s forcing us to go through a zoning change uh to do the the uh yeah which would obviously go through the zone change so what is h how is this something did talk about a little bit more off line or is this you still have time to address that yeah i&amp;#39;m happy because j hi david good to see you again and because that was the same that was the instance with the case studies i showed you in waya park and placenta they are both zoned r1 and so now that s sp4 is in place you do not have to go through a zone change right you are allowed by right to build up to 30 dwelling units per acre on that and that&amp;#39;s not and before so by right and then does density uh the bonus density laws go on top of that correct yeah well it&amp;#39;s not my project in my office i&amp;#39;m just aware of the project so i don&amp;#39;t know that the nuances i know it is under an acre and i know we are getting a lot of push back on parking the zoning change etc etc etc so so up to 30 units per acre by right yeah without a zone change correct i&amp;#39;m sure my uh associates and bosses will be happy about that so yes that&amp;#39;s the exact of project this allows right yeah and you know and i want to say and it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you&amp;#39;re necessarily gonna build at 30 dwelling units per acre right you know you know but but this bill allow permits you to right it allows you to build by right at that density what you choose to do and where how you end up building it is really up to you and as a developer and with your partners or neighbors or whatnot but yeah well i mean as i joke with all all the associates that know me as having a really bad sense of humor we all want to build the 45 foot uh 45 story um highrise that has one unit per per floor just so that we can get those 45 units in in place on that 5,000 sq foot lot so absolutely right okay we are going to edit that comment out because otherwise we&amp;#39;re just gonna scare people it&amp;#39;s a joke yeah it&amp;#39;s a joke it&amp;#39;s a joke that&amp;#39;s a good point on being recorded so right um so i&amp;#39;ll just i just because i can add my own commentary i think one of the most interesting things that i&amp;#39;ve seen come out of these most recent laws of uh sb uh uh sb6 ab 2011 um and now sb4 where they basically have made it the legislature has basically given us permission to build on any land that hasn&amp;#39;t already residential can now accommodate residential as long as it&amp;#39;s not an environmental hazard uh commercial land church land college land um and you know alexa to your point you know it may not be that those laws become the tool that is used but because that option is there suddenly cities are more willing to negotiate the density of the project so maybe they don&amp;#39;t maybe it doesn&amp;#39;t use the full density that&amp;#39;s you know possible under as before but maybe in you know you it you get a little more than you would have otherwise because you do have this alternative and you know whereas i think the benefit of new housing is is housing for our community housing for families housing for our neighbors uh the things that come when you have uh more population you can have nice things um i think people are always a good thing but um i know not everyone sees it that way but uh so it helps us get there so and um grateful for the for the foresight to uh from the legislature to give us more tools in the toolbox so um we&amp;#39;re at 110 i think we&amp;#39;re going to wrap because i want to respect everyone&amp;#39;s time and just want to thank alexa again and mossi for being willing to do this webinar um we really want to promote this as a tool and get the word out about the opportunity that sb4 brings so again really grateful uh to m and inner city law center for sponsoring this bill uh to uh senator scott weiner for carrying this bill uh to all the other bill sponsors the carpenters union uh all my yb friends and relations who helped uh get it over this uh get it over the the finish line and um especially to auam deas at uh was at nph now has since moved on to work for one of the legislators but would be remiss if we didn&amp;#39;t uh plug him as the the driving force behind this and keeping us all shephered together to to support it across the finish line so thanks to all of them and thanks to you alexa and and national corp and mty and inner city law center for your time today and we will uh make uh the slides available to everyone who registered um we&amp;#39;ve had questions about contact information uh could we potentially put that contact information uh in that email that we send as a follow-up yes yeah you&amp;#39;re i i thought i left my email so yes please if you if anybody has followup

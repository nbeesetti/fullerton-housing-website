{"videoId":"GntTXqYXcfQ","combinedText":"and i&amp;#39;m going to go ahead and start recording um so i want to thank you all very much for coming um this is a panel that is near and dear to my heart as a person of faith i have long wanted to marry uh my personal belief system with uh the ethos of my work in providing housing for my fellow neighbors uh who have money and who don&amp;#39;t have money and and to really be an agent of change in that way and so when i got introduced to um sarah walker and the team at national core because of the housing project that was done in placenta and in buena park at uh church of the blessed sacrament and in placentia and in st joseph&amp;#39;s in buena park um it was an awesome opportunity to bring together uh the developer and the bishop and then i knew also about uh rusty bailey mayor rusty bailey uh and in his term the amazing work and the amazing social capital that existed in the riverside community of churches and his functional ending of veteran homelessness while he was mayor and he did that with the help of the churches and so there are some awesome stories uh in this group there are also a lot of awesome stories that are not in this in this group so i i in no way want to um say that um this is the network of folks that i knew and i i could pull together but there are undoubtedly other other folks in other parts of california other parts of southern california and we&amp;#39;re gonna have an opportunity to hear about them from um jill shook who has a non-profit that she started called making housing happen and that works with um different different types of churches in uh l.a county predominantly but also in colorado so we have a lot to learn from all of these panelists so i&amp;#39;m just going to go really quickly around rusty bailey is the former mayor of uh the city of riverside now he is the head of the path of life ministries uh bishop john taylor is the episcopal bishop of the l.a archdiocese of the episcopal church yes i i&amp;#39;m a little in awe um sarah walker works with national core she&amp;#39;s a planner and a a person who does entitlements for uh development national core stands for national community renaissance they are um i think one of the largest nonprofit developers they&amp;#39;ve done a lot of projects around here they&amp;#39;re based in rancho cucamonga which is in the skag region and again jill shook has a ministry through making housing happen and i will let her she&amp;#39;s written a book uh which i can&amp;#39;t remember the title of but i think it&amp;#39;s making housing happen and if it is that would be great i know her website is makinghousinghappen.org um and then i want to just introduce myself um my name is elizabeth hansberg i founded the yinvi group for orange county called people for housing in 2017 and then in 2020 we merged into yimbi action which is a larger umbrella organization for uh local yimbi groups and that&amp;#39;s why it says yummy action because i have not yet renamed myself um so with that i am going to turn it over to bishop john for his his uh his comments to us about what would compel congregations to want to do this thank you and take it away bishop john elizabeth friends thank you so much elizabeth for organizing this panel and all others for being present after what i&amp;#39;m sure has been a busy day much of it spent on zoom and yet here you are using discretionary time for the sake of the least among us to be on yet another zoom call i first met elizabeth when she brought her considerable energy and theological fire power in terms of faith in action alongside national corps and the people of saint joseph&amp;#39;s church in buena park to enable a successful city council vote on behalf of our project there she&amp;#39;s an absolute marvel and she&amp;#39;s organized this evening beautifully so elizabeth thank you as she&amp;#39;s told you the question to me is what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s in it for the church and and it&amp;#39;s a good question it&amp;#39;s a question rooted in language about transaction isn&amp;#39;t it about about getting our interests served about getting value for our money um and and this is by and large helpful language for nations and and for enterprises but the contract i&amp;#39;ll begin with is what people of uh the abrahamic faiths all uh three or four billion of us call the abrahamic covenant it comes from the abraham cycle of stories in the book of genesis which is part of torah for those who who revere the hebrew scriptures in and of themselves and i will not um i will not go into a long bible study on the abraham cycle i i will just put it in the terms i used with the fifth and seventh graders i used to teach religion to down at st john chrysostom church in rancho santa margarita in orange county and and this was this was all they had to learn in three semesters to get at least to be that the abrahamic covenant is god loves us we love god god loves us we love god now you&amp;#39;ll notice there&amp;#39;s a semicolon in there you maybe heard it god loves us we love god there&amp;#39;s not a so or therefore it&amp;#39;s not strictly transactional it&amp;#39;s not we love god because we owe it to god because he gave us all these goodies it&amp;#39;s more profound than that it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a thing that happens when we finally recognize that we&amp;#39;re truly god&amp;#39;s beloveds it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not necessarily when we&amp;#39;re taught it but one day by god&amp;#39;s grace we experience it so you see a friend you never met before like elizabeth full of joy and justice uh in the lobby of the city council chambers of of of the city of buena park and and it&amp;#39;s one of those reminders that comes along that that that we&amp;#39;re all doing the same work together whether lutherans or episcopalians or or baha&amp;#39;is or muslims or people who just believe in in inhumanist values if they&amp;#39;re rooted in love whatever they are where all of us doing the best we can and you have those moments that you realize you&amp;#39;re bathed in god&amp;#39;s love and once you realize that you want to glorify god and you want to care for god&amp;#39;s people so a well-lived christian life and perhaps this can be said for all people of faith is that we live and learn our way past worrying quite so much about protecting our accumulated possessions and territory protecting our prerogative protecting our privilege we realize that peace truly comes from putting other people first you may remember our episcopal presiding bishop michael curry whom we&amp;#39;re very very proud of and you may remember him from harry and megan&amp;#39;s wedding uh he calls it the way of love so so that the answer to the question what&amp;#39;s in it for the church is that by following the way of love by moving over and providing a place for our neighbors we get to do what we&amp;#39;re created to do so we should say thank you for giving it up for housing now a christian would elaborate it with a little bit of scripture a christian would say well we also follow a savior who had nowhere to lay his head we follow a savior who promised salvation to those who treated those who were most in need as though they were jesus and a christian ethicist would add this there&amp;#39;s something in the human character and we all have it it&amp;#39;s part of our gene that contributes to sort of self-protection which is not always a bad thing but it also can tempt me to look at the weakest or the least privileged individual in a system and construe that individual is a threat it happens over and over again there&amp;#39;s a debate now in the wake of some decisions that the president&amp;#39;s made in washington about the rights of our transgender siblings they comprise perhaps two or three percent of the population and yet you would think from the controversy that this tiny cohort was on the verge of destroying women&amp;#39;s sports and taking over the entire olympic movement think what you will about the issue my friends that&amp;#39;s not my point my point is always to remember that humans are tempted to turn victims into victimizers to protect position and privilege we do it with the unhoused as well we we construe them as criminals and destroyers of property values but the person of faith as prone as anyone to these impulses we remember if we&amp;#39;re christians jesus saying whoever cares for the least among you cares for me the homeless person is not necessarily jesus our unhoused sibling may not be our savior incarnate but jesus is watching how we treat them nevertheless i have a practical answer too about what&amp;#39;s in it for the church money there was a great boom of church building in southern california after world war ii many of you know this story well there was unprecedented growth in the mainline protestant denominations especially and so in the suburbs by and large but also closer into downtown areas we&amp;#39;ve got these big churches on big pieces of property that were designed for congregations which in the late 40s the 50s early to mid 60s were perhaps two three or four times the size of the congregations that are there now so right now a lot of our churches have some understandable anxiety over attendance decline now i don&amp;#39;t want to be too much of an optimist about this we are in a secularizing time and fewer and fewer people will pro profess a denominational faith although polls do suggest that almost all people still believe in a power in the universe larger than ourselves also we in the church have not always distinguished ourselves and representing the values of god as we&amp;#39;re supposed to and finally a lot of the younger people among us are not wild about older institutions but basically what&amp;#39;s happening in the denominational church is that we&amp;#39;re reverting to our pre-world war ii condition we&amp;#39;re not much smaller now than we were in the 1920s and 1930s so my faith is that churches are going to continue to thrive if they cultivate their curiosity about the lives their neighbors are living especially lives that are different from the ones that we are especially when we cultivate curiosity across lines of different diff uh differences in culture language and social economics and then once we&amp;#39;re curious we begin to form relationships once we form relationships we recognize our obligation we begin to live into the way of love and then we are hooked when we get to know people on the ground the way mayor rusty has gotten to know unhoused people in the city of riverside on the ground mano amano we fall in love and we naturally apply whatever resources they have god loves us we love god it&amp;#39;s automatic and if churches in southern california are doing that and if they got if they&amp;#39;ve got real estate and room to spare well that ends up being the way of jesus that ends up being the way of love that ends up being the gospel according to ground leases and the next preacher on tonight&amp;#39;s card sarah walker uh she&amp;#39;s gonna she&amp;#39;s gonna take up the story of how it actually happens oh my goodness thank you so much it&amp;#39;s gonna be a hard act to follow you um thank you for having me um i&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead and share my screen i&amp;#39;m not as eloquent as the bishop so i will be using slides in order to tell my story um so i am a senior project manager with national community renaissance i&amp;#39;ve hold on just a moment while i get this up and running my apologies what&amp;#39;s up it&amp;#39;s running oh it is okay great um thank you for that then um so yeah my name is sarah walker and i&amp;#39;m a senior project manager with national community renaissance also known as national core and i am really excited to get to be part of this panel and to share some of my stories and experience working on developing affordable housing and partnership with local churches in orange county so um sorry i don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s happening here sorry guys i even tested this a few times beforehand and i&amp;#39;m still managing to mess it up okay let me reshare okay there we go is it back up you guys are able to see it okay and we&amp;#39;ll try again advancing the slides and it&amp;#39;s not advancing for me this is going to be interesting um do you want to you want to send it to me and i&amp;#39;ll uh you want to send it to me and i&amp;#39;ll show it and then you can tell me to advance it yeah let me sorry i should have sent it to you ahead of time let me try one more time to see if i can get it up and running okay okay that over there okay not yet yeah and it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not working my apologies somebody wrote in the chat that you have to click start from start from first slide in the slideshow okay sorry okay i think that i have it up and running again so let me share my screen one more time and okay see if it advances can you now see it yes all right okay my apologies let&amp;#39;s start this again so um i am with national community renaissance and i wanted to just i&amp;#39;m kind of quickly share that we are a non-profit affordable housing developer as bishop john was sharing we specialize in family and seniors as well as special needs communities throughout southern california and we also believe that both people and place matter and that leading a healthy lifestyle really starts with the basic requirement of having a stable and affordable home um so just kind of a quick overview of national core we have been doing this for quite a while almost 30 years and we own and operate roughly 10 000 units about 8 500 of those units are located in southern california and one of the things that i feel does make us unique is that we have a number of departments in-house you know from acquisitions to the entitled land entitlement process financing as well as construction and then continuing into operation we like we continue on to own our properties for the long haul and we consider ourselves to be part of a neighborhood when we develop housing we stay for the long term and want to be a good neighbor so as bishop john was bishop taylor was starting to share you know the reality is in the past most developers have looked to public agencies cities or housing authorities to develop affordable housing on publicly owned land you know we also occasionally do work with brokers to identify you know vacant or underutilized sites that may have come on the market um however you know as cities become more and more built out it is becoming increasingly difficult to find these large lovely flat rectangular parcels um to develop on and so in the last few years we have seen that within most existing neighborhoods there are quite a few info opportunities especially when you start to look at the number of churches particularly in orange county and so in some instances we do have a project where a church was consolidating their campuses due to a decline in um in their congregation numbers and so that created a surplus property um for tonight what i wanted to talk about is two projects that we are um develop or that we are working with in partnership with um the diocese of the episcopal diocese of los angeles um as well as the local churches um in order to actually do infill development on sites where the churches are going to remain and continue to operate um so these two projects are located in the cities of placentia and buena park and they are both partnership projects with the diocese and we have been really fortunate to have bishop taylor and the leadership of both churches as kind of our biggest supporters on these projects i&amp;#39;m going to share a little bit about each one and kind of then some of the challenges that we face on both of them the first one that i wanted to talk about is the santa angelina senior apartments in the city of placentia it&amp;#39;s a partnership project with national core the blessed sacrament episcopal church the diocese of los angeles and also initially included the episcopal community services and they actually were the ones that connected national core um with earth because they had this vision of introducing affordable housing onto their site but needed some guidance and assistance in making that happen so we um this site is located at 1314 north angelina drive um and it&amp;#39;s roughly 3.9 acres and you can see the church is centrally located in the center of the site it operates out of two main buildings a parish hall and they also have a classroom building and then they also have a large um surface parking lot and there&amp;#39;s also kind of at the northern and southeastern corner there are kind of undeveloped landscaped areas so we love this site because looking at it has a pretty good walk score and it&amp;#39;s pretty accessible to a number of amenities which for us is the developer we look for when we&amp;#39;re trying in order to score well on our financing application it&amp;#39;s often something that increases your competitiveness um for funding so national core on this project is proposing to develop a senior affordable housing community that will have 65 units in two buildings 58 one bedroom units and six two bedroom units and one studio and the overall density for this project is actually only 16.7 join units per acre and the buildings are both only two stories in height and you can see this church is going to remain in the center and we&amp;#39;re going to be constructing the two buildings on either side kind of creating an interconnected campus um the residential development will have a number of amenities um including community room and gardens and a fireplace outdoors as well as seating areas and then um you know in order to actually develop building one we are going to have to demolish the church&amp;#39;s existing parish hall and so we worked very closely with the vestry in order to redesign and create a new parish hall design which will be constructed as part of the project as well as kind of a courtyard area um creating a nice kind of community space off of angelina drive and with parking really quick there are 85 existing parking spaces for the church and we are going to be adding 45 for the residential units so there will be a total of 130 units but the density or the parking ratio for the residential piece is actually only 0.7 spaces per unit and just kind of to give you kind of a vision of what we&amp;#39;ve developed here it&amp;#39;s this is the view of building one that&amp;#39;s at that northern end of the property showing how those new residential units are going to kind of interface with the new parish hall here&amp;#39;s another view showing this is the other building building two the southern end that will be facing the single family homes across morse and um you can kind of see how the building at two stories it&amp;#39;s you know a pretty low scale and it&amp;#39;s been designed to carefully um fit into the existing neighborhood context so as i mentioned santa angelina will have 64 affordable units um two households or seniors rather that are earning less than 60 of the area median income and 21 of those units are set aside for permanent supportive housing for formerly homeless seniors and then there will be one exempt managers unit so the other project i wanted to share is orchard view senior gardens or orchard view garden senior apartments which is in the city of buena park and this is the one that we were fortunate to have bishop taylor attend the city council hearing and express his support and we had a great hearing for this particular project but it was a long process to get us there so um again this is a partnership project between national core saint joseph&amp;#39;s episcopal church the episcopal diocese of los angeles and also ecs or episcopal community services and it was initiated in 2018 after national court got involved in the santa angelino project in the city of placentia so this particular development is located at 8300 valley view boulevard and it is a 3.2 acre project site that is currently home to st joseph&amp;#39;s church you can see it&amp;#39;s located on the southern portion of the site and surrounded by surface parking and it&amp;#39;s a single building and then the northern portion of their site is relatively undeveloped there is an old um there is an older building on there uh and as well as just vacant kind of un unlandscaped area so the project proposes to actually subdivide the existing parcel into two new parcels and so parcel one would maintain the church and the surface parking and then the new parcel on the northern end um will be developed with new affordable housing and so this shows you kind of the concept so on parcel this northern parcel we&amp;#39;re going to we&amp;#39;re proposing 66 residential apartment homes also for seniors um this is 62 one bedroom units and four two bedroom units and um they&amp;#39;re proposed in one larger building that&amp;#39;s three stories as well as nine single-story casitas along the northern property line um the density for this project is actually 37.5 dwine units per acre because it&amp;#39;s a smaller parcel and it&amp;#39;s not as spread out um so we had to carefully design this project with context to the neighborhood um it&amp;#39;s two stories fronting the street it steps up to three stories back down to two and then we have the one story because he does along the property line um so the church had an existing 121 parking space lot on and in order to develop the housing we are having to actually remove um 48 spaces and so or i&amp;#39;m sorry we are having to remove 46 bases and we will be adding 48 spaces for the residential units which is a parking ratio of 0.72 spaces per unit we&amp;#39;ll talk a little bit more about parking in just a minute um so here this kind of shows you the this shows you that larger building one and how it&amp;#39;s going to look in the context of um with the church so you can see it&amp;#39;s kind of set back and it kind of creates like a nice um open space for the church chasing the street the building behind it and then this kind of shows you that internal courtyard area this is would be if you&amp;#39;re kind of standing at the church and looking at the housing um you can see how there&amp;#39;s the building one that&amp;#39;s three stories and steps down into the lower density costitus and again this project contains 65 units and um sorry 66 units and 50 65 of those will be affordable to households earning 60 of the area median income or below um and eight units are set aside as permanent supportive housing there would be one exempt managers unit so to dive into the challenges a little bit um so in navigating the entitlement process the reality is is that there are a number of entities that are involved um and they often all have strong opinions and they all have you know certain requirements that they need to have met and so you know you&amp;#39;ve heard a little bit from bishop john about you know you have the church as the landowner we you know and the visionary often for these projects um we also had the church vestry for each you know for saint joseph&amp;#39;s as well as for the blessed sacrament as well as the congregation members um we also had to you know get involved with city staff and also elected officials to make sure that we are um that the projects are meeting the codes and the development objectives for the city you also have neighbors who are living in the you know surrounding area that are ultimately impacted by this new development occurring near their homes and then there&amp;#39;s us and what we need as a developer in order to for example navigate deadlines for certain funding sources and also trying to make sure that all of the stakeholders are ultimately pleased with the final product so i wanted to share this is actually a slide that um we included it oops i this kept advancing um i&amp;#39;m gonna it&amp;#39;s gonna keep advancing so i&amp;#39;m just gonna let it go but ultimately what this um what that slide is showing is the number of meetings that we had um for our placenta project and it actually doesn&amp;#39;t even depict all of them but it shows the various steps that we had to go through of you know meeting with the church vestry and getting a plan together and then taking it to the city staff and getting their approval taking it to the development subcommittee and getting their approval and then to the community and it just kind of shows this winding you know trail of all these meetings and outreach that was conducted in order to try to ultimately um you know come up with a design that ideally everybody is feels good about and so you know that winding trail of outreach meetings also kind of resulted in a winding trail of different sites and iterations which is what is being shown on the screen right now so you know generally with each meeting that we&amp;#39;re having there would be a series of meetings with our design team in order to adjust the site plans and to react these things so specific to um this is the placenta project and it shows you kind of the evolution of how the design um evolved over time you can see that the building footprints kind of shift from side to side depending on the meeting that we had you know had at that time whether it was city staff or the neighbors or the church festery and so um you know ultimately i guess you can see that you know that final site plan um you know we were able to kind of figure out a solution that all of the stakeholders ultimately maybe everybody gave up a little something but everybody felt like they could live with it or at least feel good about it so really the moral of the story is talk to your neighbors very early on you know talk to city staff very early on so that you can understand their concerns and get their input um and then you know ultimately there will be people that still just don&amp;#39;t want the project and in that case you need to call elizabeth and the people for housing and you need to talk to her about strategies on how to garner support because she was you know very critical in helping get this project um getting both of these projects approved um the second challenge i wanted to talk about is the complexity and the number of applications that were required in order to get the developments approved for placentia we needed a general plan amendment um from low density residential to high density residential we needed to rezone from our one to r3 we had to request a parking reduction based on the affordability units we also had to go through the development plan review process which required a pre-application a development ad hoc subcommittee meeting um community meetings ultimately back the development subcommittee and then finally approval hearings um and because we were we were doing a general plan amendment we also had to complete an initial study mitigated negative declaration for sequa which required a number of technical studies and also it does add time to the project it&amp;#39;s necessary but it does add time um and so just to share the pre-application meeting for this project was actually back in april of 2018 and approval happened in december of 2020 so you can see that it took over two and a half years um to actually get the placenta project approved and similarly for buena park we also had to do a general plan amendment from low density residential high density and also from residential family or single family six to medium density multifamily um we also had to do a tentative track map to divide the parcel in half and we had to go through a development agreement application which was a lengthier process but it ultimately did give us flexibility on density and parking and also a reduction in some of the development impact use um we had to do an initial study mitigated negative declaration again and so similar to placentia we had our pre-application meeting in march of 2018 and ultimately approval did not happen until november of 2020. so you know there it feels like one of the things that is a challenge for um these church sites is that they are often located in single-family neighborhoods and they&amp;#39;re often zoned for low density residential and so if there is a way to streamline that that is something that could be you know very helpful in terms of reducing the amount of time that these projects are taking to be entitled and i know that jill chuck is going to actually give i think some examples of some tools that um cities can actually implement or think about in order to reduce that time and money spent entitling some of these projects um so my last challenge was kind of a tricky one and that is just i mean as i was discussing many of these churches are within existing single-family neighborhoods or they&amp;#39;re zoned for low-density housing and so we often hear that um neighbors are they are a little nervous about change and so you know we heard from many people nearby these two projects in particular they bought their homes you know they didn&amp;#39;t think that anything was going to change and you know those parcels have been open space or undeveloped and they aren&amp;#39;t sure about um you know something being built there and so when we mention apartments i picked this image because they often think of these towers and the reality is that&amp;#39;s not what our intent is when we try to come in we&amp;#39;re trying very hard to design something that is um compatible with the existing neighborhood and so we found that like extensive education and outreach is really needed in order to kind of help the neighborhood feel comfortable um we&amp;#39;ve had to talk a lot about different you know training processes and property management tools parking management tools in order to really help the neighborhood understand um that this could be a really great thing and a really amazing asset for their community and even in you know increase their property values and just as part of that neighborhood context you know have to bring up parking and traffic because every single project i think that i&amp;#39;ve worked on it has been something that almost every stakeholder is concerned about and that is you know just making sure that there&amp;#39;s adequate um you know right away for vehicles so um again we&amp;#39;ve for these two projects we had to put together quite extensive materials for parking um from traffic analysis and parking studies to actually conducting our own internal parking survey so that we could um just give examples of utilization of similar types of projects to help elected officials and the communities feel more comfortable with what was being proposed and also i wanted to mention that last year one of the two housing bills that was passed was av 1851 which was actually something that was really great for our bueno park project because it allowed um us to reduce the number of parking spaces that were required for the church so with that i&amp;#39;ll just kind of wrap up on some of the benefits that we see um you know for national corps and the churches that we&amp;#39;re partnering with and this really has created an opportunity for everybody to kind of further a shared mission to help the community and create a legacy within the communities and it also creates an opportunity for development to serve as a catalyst national corps likes to go in we don&amp;#39;t want to just build you know one housing you know structure and leave we want to be there we want to be part of the neighborhood and try to help lift people up as well through investment of money as well as you know helping to provide services and through the community and our residents um and so you know really it also for our developments we&amp;#39;ve entered into ground leases and this does end up being a pretty mutually beneficial agreement so the churches actually do maintain ownership of the land and we are essentially leasing it from them and so they get that benefit of you know payments from that ground lease and we get the benefit of using their land to construct the housing so just with that um yeah we have also you know churches are in great areas and they provide a great resource and offer the opportunity to share parking share all sorts of different community aspects so yeah that i i thank you so much for having me awesome thank you thank you thank you thank you um i&amp;#39;m wondering if maybe we can um take just a couple of questions um maybe could you talk a little bit about um now that you&amp;#39;ve done this into like there&amp;#39;s questions i think in the chat um or in the q a from folks that are churches like are they they have themselves a member of the church community is there like what would be like earmarks that would be that would make for a good opportunity site like what would make for like a like size of a parcel or location oh boy um i think generally i mean the size of the site i mean we&amp;#39;ve developed on sites that are happening half an acre but it really depends on the zoning so i think that kind of understanding the context of what is what can be done on the site with the existing zoning and whether what sort of entitlements would be required in order to do multi-family development like i said many of these are they they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re zoned for single-family uses um and then you know for affordable housing the funding sources are pretty there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a limited number of them and so things i think i was mentioning a little bit like the scoring of these applications having good amenities close by having access to transit um you know providing um housing in high resource areas so where there&amp;#39;s good schools where there&amp;#39;s um you know access to jobs that that type of stuff is really important okay um i&amp;#39;m going to talk a little bit about that too elizabeth okay great perfect because really all you need is two volleyball courts two sand volleyball courts or a couple parking places really every everybody should be doing this every church can do at least one whether it&amp;#39;s a pallet shelter whether it&amp;#39;s a a 600 square foot two-bedroom that we you know we did four of those that&amp;#39;s what i&amp;#39;m going to show you in a second at the grove community church every church can do at least one that&amp;#39;s how we&amp;#39;re going to scale this and that&amp;#39;s how we&amp;#39;re going to get out of this crisis that we are in in california and if it&amp;#39;s a crisis we got to act like it that means all hands on deck that means that means it&amp;#39;s a whole of society approach to uh stimming the the tide to addressing the crisis and and our governor right now is providing some of these resources to do that and and as well as i can&amp;#39;t remember sb 330 was referenced but there there is i know senator weiner&amp;#39;s got another bill that it didn&amp;#39;t wasn&amp;#39;t uh brought forward for a final vote but potentially allowing faith campuses to by right develop housing as well as institutions of higher learning so we need to support that we need to continue to do what we&amp;#39;re doing and let me let me go through at first you&amp;#39;re probably laughing because i got so many hats on right and then this is my life so i got my army hat right what&amp;#39;s in it for me when i was when i was mayor you know i i duty honor country so i&amp;#39;m a west point guy and so duty honor country is why i started working on this beyond my being convicted as a christian but so what was what&amp;#39;s duty honor city mean for for me it meant making sure that everybody at housing and specifically as was mentioned earlier focusing on the veterans how can we how can we have veteran homelessness in in our country um and so so that&amp;#39;s how i started in the business as mayor here&amp;#39;s the riverside and yeah i&amp;#39;m a soccer soccer coach mentioned that earlier and then now different hat i&amp;#39;m wearing as the ceo of a path of life ministry so i&amp;#39;m back into the ministry aspect of of housing now but when i was the mayor i&amp;#39;m gonna share my screen now and show you what we did um is that showing set up yep we can see it yep there we go and did it change yes slide change yes we&amp;#39;re on riverside california good so love your neighbor initiative and um we&amp;#39;ll get to the the catalyst that brought that to my heart but i i&amp;#39;m not there mayor anymore former mayor as i mentioned that&amp;#39;s even better than being the mayor and and i got to hearken back bishop taylor uh and someone referenced i think tony mice brought that up when we filled the city council chamber with all of the clergy from around southern california you know what a night that was and so we got to replicate that um and and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s success right there for for all of you listening you gotta pack the council chambers with your friends and family and and clergy if you if if you can that was a secret that was that was part of the secret sauce for our success and it was just it was just providence god you know glory to god and everything but for that night the the clergy the diocese was uh was having an event in our in our convention center right bishop and so i was i was speaking there earlier and i challenged them to come down to city council meeting tonight and what&amp;#39;d they do they walked down main street and they came to the city council meeting and we got what we asked for amen and i thought st michaels which is episcopal church riverside that&amp;#39;s doing 50 units and i think i have a picture of that that i&amp;#39;ll show i thought that that was one of the one of the first um at least in the episcopal diocese that was going through housing so i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;m it&amp;#39;s awesome to hear the other ones that have been um that have been been before us previous uh to our to our work but here we go riverside california uh so we are a big city a lot of people think riverside still especially the orange county folks over there right some of my brethren riverside moved to orange county i saw that on the chat but i&amp;#39;m glad you still call riverside your home as do i and so riverside 12th largest city 58th in the us it&amp;#39;s biggest cincinnati uh pittsburgh st louis you know what what don&amp;#39;t we have we don&amp;#39;t have a professional sports team that&amp;#39;s the difference because we&amp;#39;re not in the middle of middle in the midwest um the only game in town kind of thing and so you see you see we you know where we lie for those of you that are from from out of california right in the middle between l.a and palm springs and howard l.a and now we&amp;#39;re to the mountains the beach we&amp;#39;re right in the middle of it in southern california the center of england southern california and you can see our faith goes way back over a hundred and something years now the nicu medical sunrise service it&amp;#39;s depicted there in those pictures and and other people mentioned um or we&amp;#39;re asking questions about other faith groups or or uh denominations that we&amp;#39;re doing some housing seventh-day adventist church for us is doing an 80 unit through core national core is developing an 80-unit multi-family housing complex on some property at the seventh-day adventist church we have la sierra university loma linda university out here and then the latter-day saint population is large out here and we&amp;#39;re working with them on some projects so love your neighbor vision god&amp;#39;s calling really convicted me back in 2016 when i wasn&amp;#39;t doing enough for my neighbors and jimmy white and bob king popped up in my head and there were those were neighbors of mine growing up jimmy white was my sister&amp;#39;s friend in in elementary school went to went to alcott elementary and was was on a bike ride with his dad in our neighborhood and his dad ended up hitting a tree in front of our house and and didn&amp;#39;t have a helmet on so jimmy runs in into our house 9-1-1 call 9-1-1 my dad just hit he&amp;#39;s bleeding he&amp;#39;s not responding and and when i was 10 years old that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s you remember those kind of things um and so we went out that&amp;#39;s the first time i saw an individual you know pretty much uh that was was dying in front of my eyes and jimmy white after that was never the same right he ended up getting into drugs to cope with the loss of his dad and ended up homeless on our streets and when i was in the army i used to come home and see jimmy and buy him a meal here and there and then jimmy disappeared he died he we lost jimmy to homelessness so that&amp;#39;s one of my neighbors that i didn&amp;#39;t love like i should have bob king similar my sister connie&amp;#39;s friend was the asb president of paulie high school and ucla and had a had a business up in in san francisco and and it ended up selling his business coming back to riverside and uh to marry his high school sweetheart well that lasted you know five ten years and he ended up getting divorced and and uh losing himself losing his wife losing himself moving home lost his parents his house bob king ends up ends up homeless on the streets riverside well i was mayor and i used to have awesome discussions he&amp;#39;s a believer um and now bob king&amp;#39;s missing in action he we lost bob thomas so that&amp;#39;s what convicted me uh towards this love your neighbor vision and the calling um you know was initially with veterans homelessness and then it migrated into more chronically homeless and organizing uh with my faith cabinet a faith summit that ended up creating opportunities for housing on church campuses and so this is the challenge that i threw out at the face summit you know one we had 400 homeless individuals let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s all adopt one homeless individual and house them you know through your through your church through your faith campus that was the vision that god gave me um legacy there&amp;#39;s always trust issues you got to get through uh you know it was the same here some challenges whether it was church and state issues getting past the former mayor or issues between city council members city city government and the faith community we got through that the path was was to yes we know that we need this um so we negotiated towards yes or discussion pastoral transition there was a transition between pastors at the grove community church so it&amp;#39;s pastor tom lance who i referenced the beginning of this presentation um leaving the faith cabinet one day he said yeah rusty we&amp;#39;re gonna do it you know how many units do you how many units do you need to put up i said well let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s start with four and so uh he went back he basically told me you know i said one i start i see you i said i said one he said no we&amp;#39;re gonna do four and and i said okay man i love your i love your boldness i love your faith so this was even before he got to his board to ask them that and and the the pastor that uh is has now taken taken over daniel bishop um uh confessed to me that he he was he was going for two you know and and and pastor tom lance was going for four and so there was even friction amongst the transitions at the at the church on how many that they were they were going to have but ultimately the the retiring pastor won out and then community acceptance as you heard in the previous in the previous uh presentation there&amp;#39;s always the nimbies that are out there even through um and they have a big campus and this is probably a 50-acre campus that the grove has maybe more but there were still neighbors that heard about this project and resisted and um you know opposed it so what we did one of the one of the challenges one of the ways we got around this challenge the solution you guys are asking for solutions some of these challenges we had meetings on the church campus at at the facility and invited the neighborhood there and so the church is being a bridge a natural bridge um inviting and feeding you know anybody that came and and just kind of we also planted a couple of formerly homeless females in the audience that ended up asking you know answering some of these questions um of the angry uh you know nimbys that were that were there uh from the neighborhood so we built the community acceptance that we needed um i&amp;#39;m getting too excited i gotta dang it i was on a roll how did i there we go um so here&amp;#39;s the love your neighbor initiative the grow village shoot do we skip over we got that that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s supposed to look like and this is what it it looks like now sweet you know and you&amp;#39;ll see 10 weeks the the schedule uh that that was a little bit different than the previous couple years worth of activity and the difference is that this was a barn bar and raising model so we really didn&amp;#39;t have to um go through jump through the same hoops general plan amendments and those kind of things we use the existing cup of the church and they just amended the cup to get us four units 600 square foot units on two two sand volleyball courts that were unused from what i understand so under utilize space on your church campus transformed into housing you know what better what better uh what better use of a property can you get than than housing for formerly you know homeless neighbors um see here so that&amp;#39;s the celebration that we had after uh at the ribbon cutting we&amp;#39;ll show you shoot somebody managing the slides now does somebody have the slideshow under which one are you seeing we see the one with the ribbon cutting oh there we go okay all right we&amp;#39;ll get this down won&amp;#39;t we so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s the timeline i mean how would you like that national core to be your timeline 10 weeks from permit to occupancy again it&amp;#39;s not multi-family housing it was four small units 600 square foot two bedroom uh but you know from when i heard that call and and when we had the ceremony was was a little over a little over a year and a half since then we&amp;#39;ve had the likes of the secretary of housing urban development ben carson come by and take a look at this and and and call this a best practice um see here some of our models here&amp;#39;s the model as i mentioned in in the lessons learned on this slide so it&amp;#39;s a high barrier uh transitional transitional you know housing concept or model the pastor manages it they sign a contract typically it&amp;#39;s a year versus shelter which is 90 days a permanent supportive housing is is labeled as permanent so there are rules and a contract and they have access to a counseling center just down the street financial literacy you have all sorts of support from a built-in community where they go to church on the weekend and sometimes eat go to bible study during the week and mentor families dropping by bringing them food and bringing them bringing them toiletries or whatever whatever else they need um some of the issues that have jumped into this or or we&amp;#39;ve learned over the last couple years is uh you know that there are gonna be there are gonna be some difficult neighbors uh difficult individuals live in in in these houses there&amp;#39;s one one story of a a lady that we um opened the door to and and found her a job at riverside transit agency rta as a bus driver well she didn&amp;#39;t like her uniform the first day and ended up i think not wearing it and at the end of the day flipped her boss off and lost her job and ultimately um you know they had to exit her and find her another place to to live they didn&amp;#39;t just throw her around the streets thank god and and the grove his sanction has allowed me to tell this story as a lesson learned but um there are you know uh issues when you have people living on your property that you gotta you gotta work through and that was one of them there was a custody dispute uh several of the the the neighbors that are that are housed at the grove um are females fleeing domestic violence with their kids and there was a there was at least one time where the father tried to gain access to the housing and they had to call some security or police to to deal with that and then this this uh individual that you see on the screen was a 18 year old emancipated minor that was sleeping at the church in the ball field next door and so so the teacher knew one of his teachers at king high school knew about his situation and and provided a bridge to the church and ultimately got him into one of the housing units he had a scholarship to cal state humboldt i believe it was and and is ultimately doing well and and college bound see here i think that&amp;#39;s about there we go and then this that&amp;#39;s as i mentioned it was a challenge to all the churches through a face summit the grove was the first one to step up and this is two other uh church campuses faith campuses i believe that st michael&amp;#39;s episcopal on the top there with 50 units they have retired friars they&amp;#39;re going to be part of the community and then and then housing for formerly homeless as well as very low income housing part of that and then crest community church the bottom one has opened up their land to place uh modular housing free pre-manufactured uh 10 units there and so really the the bottom line is each church is different each church can do something or faith campus can do something and it does depend on the community at the church and around the church as you walk through that process of of finding how god is leading you in this direction we got a couple other programs that we&amp;#39;re a part of the love your neighbor initiative social work internship came out of that you can see some of the the victories there and some of the connections um and support that we provide through our three local universities to to churches across the city and as well as the mb groups and and and uh um interestingly enough for the churches that are saying wait a second here housing on our church campus what is that gonna do for you know attendance or for tithing uh well there you have it you know that they&amp;#39;ve documented and increased uh attendance and and tithing following the grow project because of the faithfulness that they&amp;#39;ve you know uh exhibited as a part of a part of the their their campus and their church life and then the last thing housing plans engineering so all of you out there can go to this website and have it&amp;#39;s open source so you can take it right off two-bedroom um you know 600 square foot unit and you know take it take it off the the the uh the website tonight take it back to your congregation take it take a look at it and depending on which city every city is going to have a little bit different so you&amp;#39;re going to have to take it through that process and see if they want to give it a stamp of approval but for us they&amp;#39;re pre-approved in the city of riverside so any church in our city can go and pull this off open sourced and take it to the counter and and hopefully they will they will approve each of those units so here&amp;#39;s my contact information as well as the grove community church god bless you all thanks for letting me be part of this awesome thank you so much i really appreciate your insight and that gives you a little bit of a taste of a different model where it wasn&amp;#39;t a two-year process it was really uh uh everybody all hands on deck to um house literally you know two or three or four people on your campus um so i want to leave a little time uh for some q a for the folks that um have just spoken before we move into um with uh jill&amp;#39;s gonna talk about how churches can do this um but in true church style i am actually gonna make a plug uh for my organization um so i&amp;#39;m gonna rusty can you stop sharing your screen quick i thought i&amp;#39;d damn okay perfect um yeah i&amp;#39;m gonna share my screen and i am going there ah i don&amp;#39;t need to um i&amp;#39;m gonna ask that if this has been meaningful to you and if you um value the work that we are doing i would ask that you you can scan this qr code you can become a member of people for housing uh we are part of a larger yimby organization called ub action and we have chapters uh all over the state so supporting us is supporting the yinbi movement in california and and actually now we have affiliates in florida and in chicago and in denver so we are quickly becoming a nationwide movement but we are really funded by uh donations and by membership dues so if this is a value to you if you have benefited from this uh help us keep the lights on help us continue to be able to convene uh these types of meetings um so i would just ask for your membership or your support as we are moving through this um uh chris i am going to ask you to take over um i&amp;#39;m going to ask you to take over to um talk about the theme if there&amp;#39;s a theme in the comments either sorry just uh getting [music] i shouldn&amp;#39;t know how to do zoom better by now but here we are um so so we we&amp;#39;ve received a lot of great comments and questions through both the chat and the q a function i think one of the most frequent uh comments uh is it&amp;#39;s like a multi-part question uh what is the cost per unit or at least does it compare favorably on these sites compared to other public or private sites um so i&amp;#39;ll just kind of put that question out there i think sarah had answered it a bit in the um yeah written and we have we have two professionals from community development partnerships which is based in newport and they were the the developer that worked with um the st michael&amp;#39;s project in riverside so i&amp;#39;m hoping they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re there that maybe they can talk about that allison kyle yeah hey i&amp;#39;m sorry i was trying to unmute myself but yeah this is kyle payne i&amp;#39;m president of uh cdp and uh you know we found that the the the cost is actually less than normal development for affordable housing because uh oftentimes and in our situation the the church is putting up an asset they have which is the land uh in order to uh to provide the project which reduces the overall cost so it&amp;#39;s been actually really um really beneficial in our experience with the with the church maybe a follow-up to that does this help help them seek let&amp;#39;s say state or federal funding to you know help subsidize those uh projects their construction and whatnot if i if i can add to that yeah this is kyle again yeah 100 having that uh initial uh asset uh coming in and having the you know partner who&amp;#39;s the church who owns property and bringing that first to applying for funding is greatly increases your chances of getting other funding i think when we went to the city for funding uh you know that was a great resource to say hey the church is helping by contributing uh their land and also and also their resources on the services side which i think was huge um in our in our project specifically they were already providing services for the homeless community and we came in with this uh concept of adding housing to it and just we&amp;#39;re able to combine those resources together uh to then go leverage funding from the city and leverage funding from the state from the county and so on and so it&amp;#39;s really been a great way to kind of be a great catalyst to start the project wonderful another question that has come up a lot and was kind of answered but maybe we can get some more depth on is how can we make this process go faster we heard a lot about zoning could someone speak to housing elements this year that&amp;#39;s a big topic in southern california and how can we use housing elements to help get affordable housing built on these church sites sarah go for it yeah so i i&amp;#39;m an urban planner by trade and so i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;m actually working on three housing elements right now elizabeth and i have talked quite a bit about them and i don&amp;#39;t want to steal jill&amp;#39;s thunder um but there are a number of tools um that can be used and zoning definitely is one of them and you know state legislature was considering you know kind of a by-right zoning and there&amp;#39;s still a way and i think joe i&amp;#39;m assuming you&amp;#39;re going to kind of cover this a little bit okay um so jill&amp;#39;s going to talk about it but there are some zoning tools that can be used to make this kind of more of a buy right process to cut down on that time since you know you saw in my presentation you know many of these are taking almost three years from start to finish to get entitled and it shouldn&amp;#39;t it shouldn&amp;#39;t take that long but it does with sequa and the general plan and all the outreach that&amp;#39;s required i mean it it does lengthen the process so yeah i mean i i&amp;#39;ll let joe kind of dive into more to the details with the housing element though you know you can advocate for your cities to put in place programs that change the zoning um and that would be a big first step in order to and elizabeth i don&amp;#39;t know if you want to share too what um fullerton is doing so as part of the housing game plan um we&amp;#39;re looking at options and one of the options that they&amp;#39;re looking at is possibly doing um housing as a as a permitted use on religiously zoned land it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s in process it has not been finalized but i know that that&amp;#39;s one of many uh tools that the city is looking at because the arena numbers are high um so yeah just i get i think just one thing that i want to like just tease out hopefully for the audience um that&amp;#39;s it obviously the use of church property or the use of church land you know that has to come from the church um that that has to be you know a mission-driven decision on their part um but cities are uh major players in this and so you know if you&amp;#39;re representing the faith community and and this is something that you think you would like to do and you see that there&amp;#39;s opportunity in your community approaching your elected officials about making these changes that&amp;#39;s one very concrete action that you can take you can email your your planning director you can email your city manager you can email your council members um i mean ultimately this is going to be a it is a policy decision so the direction would have to come from your city council um but what better way to to exercise your your uh the democratic process then to to create more opportunity for housing and cities are looking for um places to build housing because the arena numbers um the need is so great so chris do we have a couple more questions before we turn it over to jill um we do i&amp;#39;m afraid i&amp;#39;m gonna keep stealing stealing her thunder sometimes oh okay well then let&amp;#39;s just go ahead and let her present so i&amp;#39;d like to welcome uh jill shook with making housing happen um she is in pasadena and has been doing this work for for many years um and i&amp;#39;m just going to let her take it away well good evening i&amp;#39;m just thrilled to uh be part of this panel and i first want to say thank elizabeth and yigbee for inviting me today and um and i thank everyone who&amp;#39;s here on the zoom is just awesome to see so many folks i am the executive director of making housing and community happen our website is makinghousinghappen.org we&amp;#39;ve been doing this housing justice for the last 20 years here in pasadena and we&amp;#39;ve now expanded throughout southern california we have seven teams so we&amp;#39;re working on various aspects of housing justice accessory dwelling units community land trust safe parking permanent supportive affordable and inclusionary housing and some aspects of community development and leadership development we have 25 churches within our network and uh people were training within those congregations uh to be the advocates that are needed to get this work done um and but tonight i&amp;#39;m just focusing on one of our committees called congregational land committee so this committee started about two years ago um and we&amp;#39;re very faith rooted in our approach so as we begin a new team we sense the spirits leading and um and then when we begin to see a strong leadership team emerge then we we will launch a new a new effort so one day bill burns who&amp;#39;s the principal planner for the arroyo group and a key leader at the pasadena presbyterian church in town and i were discussing this concept of congregations providing affordable housing on their underutilized land and we both sensed god&amp;#39;s leading and so um a royal group i want to tell you a little bit about it they planned pasadena&amp;#39;s the old pasadena pasadena civic center and playhouse district and they won awards um around the country for their planning efforts so phil and i began to invite key players the ex-city manager and two planning ex-planning commissioners for our city one who is the land use lawyer two affordable housing developers one who&amp;#39;s harvard trained and both either people of color latino african-americans we had a very diverse team very strong team we&amp;#39;ve met every two weeks for the last year year and a half or since its inception almost two years ago and we just began to imagine and plan how to create a powerful model listening to what churches really need to get this work done so we decided early on not to invite churches but to make our models so attractive that churches would just want to come and participate so churches with excess and unutilized land are constantly having developers call them and we didn&amp;#39;t want to be one more church or one more organization knocking at their door we wanted them to choose in as they heard about our efforts and it&amp;#39;s astounding we already have 34 churches in our pipeline without advertising and so this truly feels to us like an emerging best practice um that builds the kind of trust going forward where the churches themselves begin to imagine and contact us and so um we didn&amp;#39;t want to charge for the services we provide and so we&amp;#39;ve come up with a business plan that allows us to do this and with grant funding um and as as elizabeth mentioned um that i&amp;#39;ve written a book on what churches are doing to address the housing crisis it&amp;#39;s called making housing happen faith-based affordable housing models and um so it&amp;#39;s being used amazingly on campuses around the country even usc i i&amp;#39;m just quite astounded by that myself um but we found even in all the effort in what i that i researched in what you know uh churches doing this that it&amp;#39;s just really not always a good idea for churches to become their own developer um that for the most part um it&amp;#39;s better for them to uh to partner with an existing developer so there&amp;#39;s one chapter in in one of the earlier versions of my book that does talk about a church becoming a developer a pastor becoming a developer but he partnered with the ucla&amp;#39;s uh department of ag uh of architecture to do that a second model also featured in minnesota with a savvy developer works alongside a congregation is together they develop but um we&amp;#39;re just finding that um it&amp;#39;s best for churches to partner with with existing affordable housing developers we work closely with national core um and so much of what we&amp;#39;re doing we they&amp;#39;re even part of our team and we so appreciate tonight the presentation and the beautiful work of natural core and so um obviously they know how to win the tax credits and do all the kind of excellent work that um that&amp;#39;s needed you know and the kind of excellent units that low-income people deserve and so um working alongside the church to select uh we work alongside the church to help them select a good neighbor a good developer because it&amp;#39;s going to be a long long you know they&amp;#39;ll be in relationship for a long time so we see this also as an emerging best practice to have a church partner with an existing developer we also have come up with this five step process that we do with each congregation that we meet with we initially meet with an interested congregation uh their leader or a group of leaders to discern help help them clarify what is their vision what kind of housing do they have in mind um what population do they want to serve what part of their land do they want to see better utilized and to be good stewards of what they have we&amp;#39;ve had churches go directly to a developer and um they often point to us it says meet with these guys first you know and get get it clear what you want before you come to us um so anyway we go through these five steps we help them understand what can be done on their land we look at both financial and land use these abilities and then we provide a number of architectural concept scenarios um and then we just go back and forth with the church and tell they have something they love and that they can live with and that the neighbors can live with we even do outreach with neighbors on at this point we often work at this point with the city leaders and make sure that they&amp;#39;re all good with where we&amp;#39;re going with this and then and then it&amp;#39;s ready you know it&amp;#39;s ready to start creating an rfp a request for proposals and that&amp;#39;s then pitched to potential development partners and um we we meet with the church if they want as they&amp;#39;re making that selection and help them we provide advisement if they wish throughout the entire uh pre-development and development process um so that the church is being empowered and they know what they&amp;#39;re doing and they have wisdom um in in how they&amp;#39;re moving through this whole process uh we&amp;#39;re grateful for the grants that have allowed us to offer the service uh as i mentioned um for without charge um so making housing a community happen we&amp;#39;re very committed to racial justice and um in the area of pasadena where we&amp;#39;re doing the community development that i mentioned there&amp;#39;s about 10 ethnic churches right within a few block area majority of those are black churches and they&amp;#39;re all struggling they&amp;#39;re all struggling due to gentrification primarily that&amp;#39;s the reason and so in fact there&amp;#39;s only there&amp;#39;s one church that has only eight members left and so um several of these churches have felt the call to provide housing to stay off displacement and better utilize their land but the zoning wasn&amp;#39;t making it possible for them to accomplish their vision so i invited terry tornick makes me think of rusty tonight and you know that the previous mayor of our city so he came and um and he met these pastors and he listened he listened to their pain he listened to the dramatic stories of their the loss of their members and and then we walked around to each church and he looked at their sites and he leaned over and he said to me jill these are ideal sites for a development and i thought wow that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s encouraging you know and um so he went on to make it part of his re-election campaign um so upon deliberating after the mayor left it was just so powerful because these pastors felt hurt they one even began to cry they felt so honored to have the mayor come and really listen listen they and it was it was a powerful moment um but we have congregations throughout southern california that are hurting and they don&amp;#39;t realize that they have the very thing under their feet that can help turn their pain into joy and present an opportunity to address the housing crisis it&amp;#39;s really a beautiful thing that the first church in our 34 church pipeline um is is a black church african-american church and you know the churches they get income from this they get a fair return to their land and in the process of getting that income they this particular church has said we are going to take that money and use it to pay the rents for people that are struggling that can&amp;#39;t afford to stay in our city it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s just so powerful to see uh this this first church uh that we have worked with and how they&amp;#39;re just bringing so much um benefit to the community through this um our team continued to research so this particular church it&amp;#39;s not even at this point you can&amp;#39;t even do residential it&amp;#39;s not even zoned for housing and so um so we of all these 34 churches there&amp;#39;s almost none that have the proper zoning to allow them to accomplish their dreams and what churches would like to do with their property and so we began to imagine as a team what are we going to do to address this we did our homework we studied every church in the city we came up with a policy that would be sensitive to the character of the community but still allow for the right density then it enables the funding sources to kick in and we pitch this to each of our city council members together with all the churches within their district we we went to the planning department they loved our research and the concepts that we were coming up with and now they have created their own proposal that&amp;#39;s now working its way through all the city processes to become policy for the city um but other cities have gotten wind of this what we&amp;#39;re calling an overlay zone that we&amp;#39;ve proposed and um and now other cities have been asking us to present on how to create these overlay zones so i really hand it to national core for going through a whole um general plan amendment that&amp;#39;s a huge thing and uh and so this this essentially isn&amp;#39;t a general planned amendment this is an overlay zone that would allow every church in your city that is interested in doing this to have the proper zoning um and so now we&amp;#39;ve got other cities looking to adopt this so this is another service that we&amp;#39;re offering and um and we would be glad to talk with anyone or any city interested in just looking at some of the research what we&amp;#39;re learning and some of the best practices around this um in the process of of all of this um we are um we help churches kind of understand there&amp;#39;s a chapter in my book that talks about a theological framework for land use from genesis to revelation and that really undergirds our understanding of a god who&amp;#39;s involved in redemption at every level um of every inch of the soil and all the laws that govern how that property is to be used not just for a few but that can afford it but for all that are in need of housing so um so it&amp;#39;s a joy to be part of this redemptive process and to be told to tell you a little about our story today and allow us to share with you um and i hope that you&amp;#39;ll reach out to us to making housing and community happen um so we can together imagine you know what could happen on your church campus what can happen in your cities to get the zoning right um there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a number of questions i think in terms of property size and i&amp;#39;d just like to answer one of those questions before we go to more of a q a with everyone else but um we are we have uh proposed that this overlay amendment also includes what&amp;#39;s called adaptive reuse and so that essentially is where you can take the existing church building and use that for a different use to use it for housing and um and so in that case you could even be a small church and you might have a prop a building that you don&amp;#39;t have the money to maintain and so um but you and you&amp;#39;re not really using it and so this could be adapted into housing and that&amp;#39;s been done on a number of campuses around the country um there was one more question that i wanted to address that that sarah mentioned um sir what was the question you said i should try to focus on help me out here i think housing elements and just for cities in general kind of what are some of the tools um yeah yeah thank you thank you yes absolutely so so we are working we have a team an ad hoc committee we&amp;#39;re working with the housing element pasadena has a sizable number of units required to be planned for over 9 000 units and about 6 000 that need to be affordable so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just huge compared to most cities in orange county in other areas and so uh this is is a huge benefit for cities we&amp;#39;re finding cities are very eager to do these overlay zones so they can count all of those churches interested as part of their uh the arena which called rena is the regional housing needs assessment it&amp;#39;s the assessment of units that each city is allocated that they have to plan for so um so yeah cities are scrambling and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re very excited to look at church property doing this so yeah go ahead no i just want to read this because i think this this question from um in the in the q a from i think it&amp;#39;s from maya dunn she says assume a faith institution might be interested in doing this what would you recommend a church or faith institution do related to opportunities to get more city support would you recommend anything related to the housing element process which is going on now so i think you were sort of you gave the answer but just as a summary um if cities uh sorry if churches are interested in having their land reused for affordable housing um your city is going to have to prepare a site&amp;#39;s inventory as part of its housing element please reach out to your planner and tell them that you are interested in this um because one of the uh new criteria to have a site identified is you have to show quote owner interest there has to be some in level of interest um from the property owner so if you are interested in this um and you are representing a faith community uh yes please contact your planner they would love to hear from you because they&amp;#39;re scrambling to find locations um and if you are a planner or a or an elected official on this webinar and you uh know the faith community in your in your town or you you have a um i mean there&amp;#39;s lots of ways to get in touch you can go through the chamber of commerce you can go through the collaborative you can go through there&amp;#39;s so many community organizations that the faith community has plugged into um there&amp;#39;s ways to get it folks and if this is something that you would consider um as your city would consider doing reach out because you don&amp;#39;t know what treasures lie that just haven&amp;#39;t been turned over yet um let me just jump in here real quick and respond to that i really appreciate what you&amp;#39;re saying elizabeth and i think when churches are willing to offer their site as part of the inventory for the housing element that&amp;#39;s the first step but then oftentimes those churches don&amp;#39;t have the proper zoning to even allow that to happen and so that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re hoping to see in our housing elements overlay zones and so that would then get the zoning right so the churches indeed can accomplish what they want to do without having proper zoning that that site is is not helpful you know and so um so we would like to see every city in southern california in their housing elements have an overlay zone and and and and so they can indeed allow churches by right to do this and so this is this is key and this is what i want everyone to really pay attention to if the zoning is by right as opposed to discretionary then you can save at least a year in the development time and at least a hundred thousand dollars per project and that&amp;#39;s a conservative estimate um we we have found that getting the zoning fixed is a very time labor expensive process and i think that&amp;#39;s why i so respect national corps because they&amp;#39;re going through that painful process but um and i know rusty has talked about it and and the bishop has talked about it tonight and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just zoning dictates everything you know and so we as the body of christ of church or whatever faith group you&amp;#39;re part of baha&amp;#39;i sympathy in venice whatever it is we have a huge army of advocates and people that could show up and say this is what we want to be able to do and and they can become advocates just like every prophet in the old testament i think all of them as advocates they all spoke to kings they all spoke to those people in power about what about the about the most vulnerable that&amp;#39;s at the center of every single story in every single prophetic as uh part of the old testament that the poor and the orphan are part of that the center of that and the purpose for those those interactions with those people in power and so as the church comes together in congregations in all different flavors of faith communities work together to create this change we&amp;#39;ll get the work done you know but it takes a lot of advocates because there&amp;#39;s a lot of opposition the first time i went to the planning commission clear back in 2001 after ab 1866 was passed they had they had never seen the baha&amp;#39;i the black churches the neighborhood leaders uh two or three other churches in the in the synagogue all show up together in this in the planning commission you know they&amp;#39;re sitting there going how did you guys come together what&amp;#39;s this about you know and we just basically said we want to be able to build in our backyards you know can you make that happen for us and then we started asking them what would you like to see in your backyard and they started talking about how they um had kids coming home from college and that that&amp;#39;d be kind of a coolest old car back there and so it became personal it became real and we got the policy passed it was so exciting so this kind of excitement as we come together work together to create the change to end homelessness that&amp;#39;s what i love about what rusty said he isn&amp;#39;t just talking about doing a few housing units he wants to end homelessness and i think that&amp;#39;s what we all should have as a goal and it&amp;#39;s not impossible it&amp;#39;s not we&amp;#39;ve lowered our homeless count in pasadena by 54 in the last 10 years and i and i know that we can end homelessness as we continue to work together thanks awesome i don&amp;#39;t think i can uh say anything more to add to that um we are two minutes from 7 p.m i want to respect everybody&amp;#39;s uh time but do you want to say a few closing thoughts bishop taylor and sarah and mayor bailey uh i just want to thank my colleagues and um remind everyone that we&amp;#39;re continually engaged in a dynamic of change and of letting go and of letting god and moving toward the light um and and uh these experts have shown all the different ways we can sort of move move ourselves a little closer to the life by working the problem and being hopeful and being especially being communicative and collaborative with people who are inclined to be in opposition listen to them as much as we listen to the advocates and just move it forward and do the work and you are all amazing prophets and thank you sarah you want to say i just wanted to say that i i honestly actually think that the process of working these church partnership projects has been some of the most fulfilling and i&amp;#39;ve definitely met some of the most passionate people on these projects and it has been really inspiring to work with with all of you and um yeah i look forward and hope that this is something that you know can play a a big role in you know building more affordable housing throughout southern california yeah well i want the bishop to you know do the benediction he&amp;#39;s i yeah i put a couple things in the chat you can&amp;#39;t end homelessness without housing um jesus was homeless and i loved the i love the bishops jesus is watching uh praise and cultivating curiosity and developing relationships and and my my mantra is everything rises and falls on leadership and so those of you out there that you are looking at how do we start this it it takes leadership and that means this elected officials that means the faith community that means the private sector the business community all coming together again sitting around the table and figuring this out and supporting each other so i&amp;#39;m here to help and would love to come talk to your congregations your city councils your chambers of commerce whatever whatever i can do to help you all out you know elizabeth has has heard me on the on the pulpit with with with skag and the regional housing needs assessment and um boy that that that those numbers are overwhelming um for individual for for individuals but also for for cities but you know what that&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re not thinking about the power of god and the power of of the church coming together and opening their doors and opening their parking lots and and opening their space to do housing and what more important what more important what&amp;#39;s more important at home bishop you know that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s where else that&amp;#39;s where it all started didn&amp;#39;t it jill yeah i just think about what foundation of our society that moses was asked what do you have what do you have in your hand and i think we just need to start there we have parking lots we have a lot and and i want to offer another resource that i didn&amp;#39;t mention and i&amp;#39;d like to close out with this is that we do one day housing justice institutes and these provide an opportunity for the city to come together and grapple with this and think about it theologically and uh we&amp;#39;ve done these around the country they&amp;#39;re a powerful tool so uh talk to me about that if you want to see an institute in your community but uh yeah thank you this has been great appreciate your time awesome well i i&amp;#39;m very grateful for your your time and your expertise and joining joining us this was uh something that i wanted to do uh when i when i met bishop taylor and i kind of was a bit in awe because i don&amp;#39;t think i&amp;#39;ve ever met um a famous clergy person and i got to meet one so it was a little a little awestruck um but i was also awestruck at listening to mayor rusty bailey speak at skag i was there when they made that vote uh in person so this really for me was a passion project to bring together my training as a planner and my belief in really loving your neighbor in a way that is sacrificial because that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re called to and so if you consider yourself a person of faith being a nimby is not an option because you&amp;#39;re being asked to give of yourself and and that is that is why i do this work so with that i am going to say thank you to all of you for your time and your expertise and your kindness to me in making yourself available i&amp;#39;m going to say thank you to the 72 people that are still on this webinar and we had 130 at the top uh when in the middle so i definitely consider this a success we will follow up with a link to this recording and with contact information definitely for jill definitely for mayor rusty and sarah if there&amp;#39;s somebody at national core that we can put forward and uh bishop taylor if there&amp;#39;s someone at the diocese that we should well i mean you guys have your own

project on uh the city in the city of garden grove on the campus of um garden grove united methodist church okay come on all right let me try different one there we go okay i&amp;#39;m gonna go ahead

agency over the past 16 years t has directed and managed various phases of development from acquisition to completion of 39 projects for a total of over 4 000 apartments throughout california those are the guests that are joining us today to tell the story of wesley village why are we telling the story why was people for housing orange county motivated to tell this story as you know if you are on this webinar or or watching in the future you probably know that we have a shortage of affordable housing um there was a bill a couple of years ago called um i think it was sb 899 which proposed making affordable housing on church or faith community property uh but what&amp;#39;s called a buy right use which means you could go ahead and build it with sort of minimal um review discretionary review um that bill did not pass but the root of the idea really took hold and in orange county right now in the sixth cycle arena a lot of cities are looking to faith communities in their cities as sites for affordable housing and some cities are going as far as writing uh development ordinances development standards um to enable this use um sort of as a buy right you know that you wouldn&amp;#39;t have to have you know as many hearings as you would have um as if it was a discretionary use so i wanted to put this message out into the world because i wanted to show what was possible what does it look like when a city or a community decides that they&amp;#39;re going to allow affordable housing to be built on their camp uh sorry on church campuses or faith community uh land in their community um it you could think that it would work well you could think it would not work well and i wanted to bring an example to life of how it works in orange county so that&amp;#39;s that was the motivation for bringing this bringing this webinar to you today now we&amp;#39;re going to talk about what does it look like on the ground and our first fight speaker is going to be benjamin sanchez thank you elizabeth hello everyone thank you for joining us i hope you guys are having a good day so far good week so again my name is benjamin sanchez and i&amp;#39;m going to talk a little bit about jamboree first and so jamboree we are a non-profit developer that provides affordable housing for working families seniors and people with special needs we&amp;#39;ve been transforming lives for over 32 years now as our organization was founded in 1990 our mission as it states is january delivers high quality affordable housing and services that transform lives and strengthen communities and our vision is every person will live a strong healthy and sustainable community so we are again one of the largest non-profits in the state of california and our main belief of why we&amp;#39;ve grown so much is that we are a very driven group of people here at jamboree uh this is demonstrating our development and our ownership of over 10 000 affordable rental units in over 100 california communities and the amount of resident services that comes with building these beautiful projects next slide please my computer is having issues no worries there we go so a little bit about wesley village so wesley was completed in 2017 and it&amp;#39;s located in the city of garden grove our property is a multi-generation community with seniors and families housing the housing development wesley has two three-story buildings with a total of 46 apartment homes 30 of them are for working family units and the other 16 units are for seniors our ultimate purpose is to deliver and maintain high quality housing for garden grove residents as well as to create a sustainable community benefit for the surrounding neighborhoods with the apartment community as the platform for facilitating services and programs and as you can see on the slide you can see that our household earnings are between 50 to 60 percent of our area medium income that means that between 53 000 and 63 000 is the income for a family of four per year if you compare that to families here in orange county alone it&amp;#39;s very low and you can see it&amp;#39;s a very vulnerable population with the average being 106 000 uh and next slide please now we&amp;#39;re going to talk about what made this project possible and it really is a collaboration between three actors in our story uh the faith community of garden grove united methodist church the developer jamboree housing and then the city of garden grove wayne would you like to talk about sure garden grove united methodist okay first of all i want to let you know that our church is about 150 years old and we at that going back that time property was not an issue about acquiring and and recent in the past maybe 20 years one of our neighbors willed one additional lot to the church so we had about 2.2 acres to uh work with our our conference determined back in about 19 i&amp;#39;m sorry 2014 2013 2014 that uh due to to the projected membership of the church and the local churches around our church was is uh was a designated uh foreclosure so what we did at the local church is said get a committee together to consider what is the future of our church and uh one of the ideas was the housing project on our unused property uh it uh which turned out to be the right thing to do uh the housing project it would provide a long-term revenues to to sustain the mission of the church the buildings and the operations next slide key to success was picking jamboree uh jamboree had a great track record in the local area and uh we were looking for someone who uh who had experience uh they only had they not only did the construction but also managed their project after the construction and because they managed it they our feeling was that they would do a better job of construction because they don&amp;#39;t want to do their prayers necessary while they&amp;#39;re managing it a second uh very uh important factor was the full service law firm that would represent the church&amp;#39;s interests and ensure the long-term mission of the church um we feel that this is not only just jamboree but this full-service law firm was really a significant uh part of the project because they uh they did they were able to take care of property alignments uh city permits and everything like that so it was a it was a very good decision we made the process included numerous information meetings with the congregation and neighbors uh working with the city and because head start school had been on our property for a dozen years uh we had to take their uh their concerns into uh consideration so it uh it worked out very well uh we uh uh we uh uh are very good neighbors with the project and they&amp;#39;re very good neighbors with us great thank you wayne um our next speaker is going to be t tran and he&amp;#39;s going to talk about how this deal was able to be done how it all came together and what the factors were that enabled jamboree to be successful all right thank you elizabeth um i&amp;#39;m having technical issues let&amp;#39;s try that okay that&amp;#39;s okay thank you um so for this project and just like any project development project um you know the partnership is a key to um delivering quality projects um affordable housing projects so you heard the you know the discussion with um the church and the city being our partner involved uh in the deal um and like wayne said you know it start with you know the property so without the property you know you can&amp;#39;t do any projects so you know it&amp;#39;s great that you know the the church um you know had this vision and partly because you know their entire situation then so it helps to uh to have um those partners come you know realize that you know they have opportunity here and and reach out and talk to us um and also with the city you know often time we work with city because affordable housing we need those gap funding and city comes forth with the soft fund that allows these projects to happen so as you can see from a funding standpoint you know the city provide us home fund which is federal money i think there&amp;#39;s also uh additional fund that um beside the home fund as i recall and then our uh as a developer we also contribute by deferring the fees so so those are you know count as a capital source and and typical to all of the pro uh forward project we have tax credit equity um tax credit and we generate that from equity from um investor like here we have boston financial and then your typical debt that you do for project is construction and permanent that&amp;#39;s provided u.s bank and take out by ccnr so those essentially are our capital stack i think there was one more as i recall that was known here uh which we apply later on is the federal homeland home loan bank um which is a source that we apply after we start construction it makes the project more competitive for it so that&amp;#39;s kind of round out the financing structure for the project next slice so uh you know you heard ben mentioned about you know jamboree um our goal on the development side here um is to make sure we uh being a developer is to bring all the stakeholders together and coordinate the design and entitlement and financing to to make this project reality so once we have the commitment from all party you know we sign the mou we uh you know get the commitment letter from the city uh then we&amp;#39;re off running trying to you know on a dual track get the design entitlement process going get the approval uh as well as looking for the you know funding from both the state you know for tax credit as well as um uh lenders and investors to come in the deal so you know we count those our financial partners that you know keeping the theme of what we&amp;#39;re talking about um and then we work closely with staff you know uh to to make sure that you know the project is is meet the design standard you know getting approval getting permits um and then our goal um you know when i joined jamboree um we have an in-house uh construction company called qdci so this is one a project that we took on that allow us to um uh you know provide for uh one-stop service if you will um so not only we&amp;#39;re developing we&amp;#39;re building it and then managing that the back end uh with resin service that&amp;#39;s been mentioned uh we&amp;#39;re also involved in lease up marketing so we help you know very typical of our projects we work with our third-party property management to to get the lease-up phone and also that process is included with the city as well you know they have a referral process and then you know to uh ben&amp;#39;s discussion about services you know i&amp;#39;ve worked on a few uh well just another developer before but uh jamri what distinguished uh it&amp;#39;s from other developer here is um our dedication to services uh is the best in the industry here um you know i i&amp;#39;m on the development side so when i you know my jobs end when you know projects complete and ben&amp;#39;s and uh asset management takes over so it&amp;#39;s important that um for the success of the project long term and and you know uh when i didn&amp;#39;t share um share a little bit about it but you know what&amp;#39;s been three four four five years now and the project is is successful uh after the vomit is is because of this you know it&amp;#39;s um it&amp;#39;s about the services the uh keeping the maintenance you know providing the providing the um all the program and classes that&amp;#39;s necessary to to help resident you know move further so next slide i want to talk about about the project design that&amp;#39;s mentioned it&amp;#39;s a 2.2 acre uh it&amp;#39;s kind of hard to tell on here but the church as you can see is on the right hand side all the classroom and white uh you know daycare all those are existing so the challenge on building this project is you know while we have all these uh part of the there&amp;#39;s a you might have seen the the new project on the left-hand side basically our underutilized parking space so we have to work um it didn&amp;#39;t show here but there&amp;#39;s a um it says leasing center community facility actually that&amp;#39;s a daycare a head start program that originally was i think was kind of on where uh there&amp;#39;s a building that you know span day care over so i think that was and jim wayne i don&amp;#39;t you know it can explain but it was demolished and then we were able to create this uh you know new community adjacent to to the church here uh so the senior building is building b on the top and um that you know is mo this is a multi-generational um property so one of our first and uh and then below is our senior uh family project that um it&amp;#39;s on a podium so it&amp;#39;s a very uh difficult site and we try to you know between all the development standard parking what have you an open space requirement we&amp;#39;re able to you know fit all this um program in so the biggest difference here i think is the um you know the community nature of this space and the multi-generational next life so this is image of a senior you&amp;#39;ve seen some other image at beginning so this is a senior project here it has um basically back up to to the other office space um but it&amp;#39;s a very uh spacious uh in my view um you know layout for for the community it has um services space in there uh each of the building itself um is uh stand alone if you will um so program and service can be run out of it there&amp;#39;s a top uh level roof um space that attendants can um you&amp;#39;ll you know use also with this project there&amp;#39;s a single garage that uh flank on the bottom there so we call this a tuck under uh building type the next slide uh this is a view of the family building courtyard so you know again uh amenity space that we need to provide for project for the family you know we have barbecue area there&amp;#39;s a hotline top lot behind this um in this image uh the center building there&amp;#39;s a laundry room um and then below this is a parking for for the family side next slide and this is just a you know unit uh image this is a senior actually a little story about this uh uh interesting um the the lady uh that lives here actually as i found out throughout the course of the project and we work very closely you know with our the community with the church community so the lady that works in the head start program on next door uh happened to um uh have her mother uh went this way so one day i went in and it&amp;#39;s like wait a minute this person looks so familiar so it turned out i found out that her mom ended up living here and she worked on the ground floor so it&amp;#39;s a nice story and she really loved her place you can see she decorated very well so it turned out a very nice community project so next slide i think that&amp;#39;s back to you elizabeth yeah so i wanted to just share a little bit about um the city&amp;#39;s role um i invited them but unfortunately there wasn&amp;#39;t anyone available to come to talk about their role but as you heard um they were significant in contributing funding this is something that local government city or county when projects are rated for being awarded tax credits at the state level um they get points and one of the categories that you can your project can earn points is is the city is the county making a contribution it&amp;#39;s like called a local match and so the fact that the city of garden grove was able to use their home funds and some of the residual redevelopment funds uh to move this project forward i&amp;#39;m sure had um a signific played a significant role in in attracting other funding so i&amp;#39;ve heard financing of affordable housing described as a seven layer cake um so the city&amp;#39;s uh input and and contributions of funding is one of those layers um why was the city motivated to do this well obviously the housing shortage has only gotten worse over the past five years but even when this project was started garden grove leadership recognized that we had a you know an affordability crisis and that there was a great need for more affordable housing one thing that i did find out in doing the research for this project is that parking was an area of concern and it continues to be an area of concern on infill projects but one thing that we do know is that if we can reduce parking requirements it becomes easier to fund affordable housing and so for projects that are located near transit high quality transit areas um reducing parking is one way that we as the city or the community um can help to sort of underwrite those costs because parking is actually quite expensive and contributing to construction costs of the development so that&amp;#39;s one area but it they did lead to a parking management plan which is working um and i know um in other projects that i&amp;#39;ve been aware of um two of the ones that we featured in our part one series um of yigbee uh that they were able to do a shared parking arrangement so parking does not need to be a barrier um to building affordable housing on your faith community&amp;#39;s property um and then the last thing i&amp;#39;ll say is just to share that in the beginning when when they were putting together the list of folks uh that would like to be residents um garden grove is one of the cities in orange county that has its own housing authority and so in the beginning they were maintaining that list but now that the project is developed um they have a there&amp;#39;s a property management firm that&amp;#39;s um contracted by jamboree to kind of manage that um the lease up process right if someone moves out and they have an open unit um it falls to the property management firm so i just wanted to talk a little bit about sort of the role that the city can play um and then going forward many cities and this is what brought this webinar to to life um many cities we are currently in the six cycle housing arena which stands for regional housing needs assessment uh we&amp;#39;re in the sixth cycle cities are being asked to find sites for affordable housing and they&amp;#39;re turning a lot of times to faith community sites and so um another role that the city can play is in creating what are called development standards or zoning code that lays out for the developer how they want to see uh residential uses on faith community land if you have clear standards as a city that&amp;#39;s another thing that the city can do to contribute um to making this an effective um you know an effective option for building more affordable housing so that&amp;#39;s the part for the fee oh i am having here we go oh nope not quite there we go okay so i&amp;#39;m going to turn it back over to benjamin who&amp;#39;s going to talk about um now that wesley village has come into fruition it has residents it&amp;#39;s a community um what is community life like at wesley village today so thanks elizabeth so again uh everyone benjamin sanchez uh talking about the services at our properties is like team mention is it&amp;#39;s not just about the development piece it&amp;#39;s also how can we help the families once they&amp;#39;re in these communities and their homes and we always assume that housing is the only thing it is the biggest factor for families to be able to move on and can be able to financially support their families in other ways but there is so much more support that they that they need and so with that being said we usually have a coordinator on site for each one of our properties here at wesley village we do have a resident service coordinator but that&amp;#39;s not enough we want to look at the holistic approach of helping all of our residents here in the community and reaching that economic stability or finding ways to be proactive and identify issues that that we could eliminate so these barriers can be and should be changed to help individuals and families live more productive meaningful and equitable lives so with that being said um we do have a resident service coordinator but we have a variety of partnerships throughout the county and throughout this you know specifically the city and what we&amp;#39;ve created is we created substations for them to be able to be here on site because a lot of times we realize that the challenge is the transportation piece for a lot of families sometimes it&amp;#39;s a single parent that&amp;#39;s trying to get to an after-school program or take their kids to uh some type of health care program or we have seniors that also have are limited in transportation as well so we like to bring those services on site and with these sub stations uh we&amp;#39;ve been able to partner with organizations like healthy smiles boys and girls club of garden grove lesser mac orange county head start give for a smile council of aging of southern california and many more uh the fact that we have all these different partners here really does take that approach of reaching out to just all ages of the family unit um and also affects different aspects of the needs and the reason why is because we believe in a model that we like to follow a lot is called the social determinants of health where it has five pillars that focus that focuses on economic stability healthcare education neighborhood and environment social and community context with these uh specific pillars we try to advocate and help the residents here at wesley village we also conduct monthly meetings and we provide outlets for our residents to speak and hear them out and hear what are the factors that are needed here at the community there are times that we might have everything here as we assume as services but residents really tell us what needs are and it could be as simple as a food program uh during the pandemic that was the number one uh challenge for a lot of residents especially for our seniors so we would uh we partner up with oc food bank and they brought their trolley which was an rv but when you walked inside it was like a little mini grocery store and our residents had the opportunity to go in their shop get the produce and the food that they needed uh to be able to sustain themselves we&amp;#39;ve had opportunities of uh healthy smiles where it&amp;#39;s an rv that also stops by is able to park and help kids with a mental health needs one of our biggest help supporters here is um the orange county head start where they have their own facility and they&amp;#39;re able to provide day care for a lot of our parents when they&amp;#39;re trying to where they work two three jobs throughout the day just to be able to afford rent and sometimes struggle because they don&amp;#39;t have that luxury of child care and so those are big factors that uh people don&amp;#39;t notice that takes an account of how to help families because again housing is a big piece of all this but there is just so much more that&amp;#39;s needed in order to help and these families to sustain for them to be able to sustain themselves and just to move forward and progress and so uh punishers like the boys and girls club where they run teen programs where they focus on anxiety issues especially with again with the pandemic so there&amp;#39;s a lot of outlets that we provide during our services um and elizabeth if you want to uh change the next slide we have a few pictures that we want to show throughout our programs here at wesley and as you can see we we focus on not just the adults but also the children and we focus on the social emotional learning for them uh a place where they could uh feel comfortable they feel safe and we uh just share with them uh just certain skill sets that they could benefit in the future our free clinic but less than that i think that is the huge advantage i don&amp;#39;t know how many free clinics are uh not in orange county but the fact that we have one on site where it&amp;#39;s literally free where we have an organization that has doctors and nurses that actually donate their time to provide these services to provide basic medicare for families that either don&amp;#39;t have the funds are based on their status as a citizen they cannot go to look for support and help these are organizations that are just hungry to help other people and it&amp;#39;s just a big factor and the collaboration between all of us in one place that&amp;#39;s what i mean about the holistic approach because we are connecting with each other where it&amp;#39;s a synergy that provides uh better outcomes for the families in our community and for the surrounding area [music] and that&amp;#39;s just a picture of the of one of the rooms at the head start all right so we got a bunch of questions in the chat um and i am gonna be the moderator and try to go through these several of the questions asked uh was asking me if we would send a link to the part one which we did about a year ago i think um with uh two churches in buena park uh two episcopal churches and um i&amp;#39;m gonna send out a follow-up email so i will make sure to put the link to the part one in that email so that you can watch it um so let&amp;#39;s see so here&amp;#39;s a question about um recertifying for income so this this person says you know if they if someone gets a new job and they start earning more money than uh what they had been learning before like do they have to move out how does that can you speak to that i can speak to that so um you know um property management they they calculate those type of decisions so for example there is times where maybe a family of four move in but their child might be 16 years old 17 years old so there&amp;#39;s an understanding that within a year or two this child might be be working eventually and so that&amp;#39;s the source of income that they&amp;#39;re going to have to account for so we don&amp;#39;t we don&amp;#39;t evict people for that uh we try to work with those families um i know it fluctuates throughout time so i think if anything it would probably be a different ami at that point or just increasing their rent based on the income but our goal our main focus is to make sure we work with them all right we don&amp;#39;t want to evict anybody that&amp;#39;s not the point here the point is we want to make sure that they&amp;#39;re gaining that support they&amp;#39;re you know we want them to be successful and so with that being said again it&amp;#39;s either we increase maybe the rent or just work within and see um how to justify that now if it is within the first year and then we noticed that the average income from the family went from fifty thousand to a hundred and twenty thousand and yeah then you know there&amp;#39;s some red flags there but we&amp;#39;re talking about within two three years you see uh an increase of maybe ten fifteen thousand dollars and that&amp;#39;s a conversation that um that families can have for the party management i don&amp;#39;t know if you want to add anything to that yeah i can um you know more on the financing side um it affects uh the back end in terms of tax credit um usually these project um you know ben mentioned the ami if you pass that threshold there&amp;#39;s a potential to lose the wealth exemption on the units and therefore it affects the um the um you know from the operating standpoint the uh property tax right so um so that&amp;#39;s the one caveat that we keep in mind when we manage the property so we&amp;#39;ll encourage you know family like bench if they go from 50 to uh to from 50 to 120 uh maybe you know um help them to look for uh if they turn out that you know we&amp;#39;re in that situation we&amp;#39;ll work with them but like ben said we&amp;#39;re not gonna push them out um but then you know the properties just need to make sure we uh we manage uh operating so um we have a question about how are the ongoing operating expenses financed now that it&amp;#39;s built yeah so the on the ongoing operating is part of how we finance uh when we underwrite the project so it&amp;#39;s pay for um basically from the um you know rent rent incomes um through the properties so it&amp;#39;s the lender uh underwrite that and uh we just rely on the project um rents to to service the debt so speaking of um the funding we have this question about who owns the building yeah so the partnerships on the building so generally the way these projects are set up is essentially two to three member of that limited partnership so jamboree is a managing general partner and um um we have an investor that gets in the deal where uh basically they&amp;#39;re taxed they they&amp;#39;re in the deal because they they provide the equity for the tax rate they get so um and then the deal uh essentially uh for the compliance period which is 15 years and um and after that you know they&amp;#39;ll exit the deal so but the partnership&amp;#39;s the one that that owns the property because i don&amp;#39;t know that answered the question there i think so um we have a question i think this question is for wayne um a couple people have asked like what was the process like for the church to even begin considering um can for the church to begin considering this and did you encounter any uh opposition from the community uh what we when we found out that we were uh going to be considered closing we decided to get the committee together of some of the members of the church and sit down and determine do we want to keep this church going if so how we gonna do it and uh uh and how would we uh uh finance it quote unquote keep you know financially keep the church going so what we decided to do is uh get together and just start thinking outside the box and and one of the one of the things that we considered was this housing project on the unused property that we had so we&amp;#39;ve jumped on that and one went for it and in the process of of thinking about this project and working with jamboree to get it built did you encounter any community pushback either within the church or without from without well i would say probably 99 of the church congregation was for it there&amp;#39;s all you know there&amp;#39;s always a few and uh we did contact all the neighbors and uh there were there some of the neighbors got together and hired an attorney uh when we were going through uh you know the information process with the neighbors but uh uh we found that the preponderance of the neighbors were absentee landlords so uh you know they really couldn&amp;#39;t have much of a uh story to counter what we were going to do it ended up that the city council we went to the city council made a presentation and the city council jumped on it and said go for it that&amp;#39;s great that&amp;#39;s awesome that&amp;#39;s what we like to hear brave city councils that tell us to move projects forward yes um so we&amp;#39;ve had a couple of questions about how the limited liability partnership is structured who the members are is the church a part of it um i don&amp;#39;t know if you feel like you can talk about that if that&amp;#39;s private information or uh well i mean uh i mean the church i think is mentioned uh they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re the deal with the ground lease right so um so they own the property uh so the prop the lp the limited pressure ground lease uh the property for long term so that&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;s structure so it&amp;#39;s a long-term ground lease of the land from the church and then the building itself is owned by the limited liability partnership right okay limited partnership not limited liability oh sorry limited partnership sorry um this another question asks um the church stated that they received some revenue um and the question is do they get a percentage of the resident&amp;#39;s rent or are they drawing money from other uses on the on the campus well we are in in uh the negotiations with uh jamboree and and the agreement signed we received a certain amount of money from them and and uh not only not just upfront but also lasted for about six years and after after the loans are paid off we will receive a portion of the rents okay so first the rents are going to pay the lenders that enabled the building to be built and then after those loans are paid back the city will receive an ongoing percentage no no the church will you&amp;#39;re true sorry yes okay but but we did res we did receive upfront funding uh from from jamboree up front yeah that&amp;#39;s capital so that&amp;#39;s not ren okay yes that is correct yes okay all right um those are the questions that uh we&amp;#39;ve gotten so far um if anybody else has oh here&amp;#39;s a question of did this did the financing of this uh use what are called project-based vouchers which i think i can answer that and say no oh yeah yeah um but in theory though they could be a funding source for for could they be a funding source for a project i know i know there&amp;#39;s been discussion that the county has the option of using 20 of uh their vouchers for projects but i don&amp;#39;t really know what that looks like in practical terms yeah what i understand is housing authority can convert them to project base so the regular tenant base voucher you call it um can be converted but in this case they did not have any for the project so okay um let&amp;#39;s see this this person asks a question is 46 units a typical uh like this the size of a typical uh development by jamboree and um would a larger would a larger community with more apartments would it need more staff yeah so i can answer that um so typical this is on a smaller side a larger unit it ranged from you know anywhere in i believe the smallest is like 25 that we have and gone up to a hundred so i know ben might know hundreds some odd project but from a you know findings financing affordable housing uh depending on the type of tax rate program you go after there&amp;#39;s a certain sweet spot particularly with what we call the nine percent application there&amp;#39;s a sweet spot around 60 70 units that&amp;#39;s how you can score and get funding uh obviously nowadays it&amp;#39;s changed drastically with you know four percent being more competitive now as the state are pushing for more production um so the four percent program actually allow you to build i&amp;#39;ve seen projects up to like 200 300 units so um you know you get less tax but then you&amp;#39;re able to leverage more bonds and rents are higher in those instances the nine percent program are uh deeper targeting versus the four percent although like i said that&amp;#39;s changing now as well um so the world&amp;#39;s been turned upside down right now with uh you know covet and construction costs going to roof supply chain so things a little bit out of whack right now in affordable housing but um i think everybody&amp;#39;s trying to make the you know deal work so um we&amp;#39;ll see i think you know things need to settle down a little bit here um with all this stuff going on but uh but that&amp;#39;s a cycle of development you know um [music] um yeah so i know that kind of answered the question i think it does um a couple questions about occupancy rate do you have a lot of vacancies usually no ben maybe can answer that because these are very high demand well yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s uh i don&amp;#39;t have the number for the uh the vacancy rate but it is slow um it&amp;#39;s really rare when we have um opening center units and then our i mean our wait lists are yeah are even closed at this point uh for example not necessarily for wesley village but we do have a property at clark commons coming at buena park sorry name clark commons and it&amp;#39;s a 75 unit apartment complex and we had over 35 families apply for that property and so 3 500 right 300 3 500 families applying for 75 apartments yes and so um that tells you like the need you know how how a lot of people are looking for affordable housing so our wait list are closed um at an average it takes five to seven years for somebody to from the waitlist to get a a unit um i mean under uh special circumstances sooner than that but that&amp;#39;s our the average factor great thank you um there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s been a couple of questions um asking about uh the impact of crime and i&amp;#39;m actually gonna answer this question myself um there&amp;#39;s a lot of data that&amp;#39;s been done there&amp;#39;s been studies done about um the impact of affordable housing on the surrounding community but right now as we speak um the center uh let&amp;#39;s see hold on livable the livable cities initiative the livable cities initiative at uh university of california irvine so uc irvine livable cities initiative in the school of social ecology is right now putting together uh they did a study on orange county and about uh the sites that have been uh chosen for affordable housing and i think it&amp;#39;s like either i think it&amp;#39;s since 2000 and they did a study of it and that data is forthcoming so in early june they&amp;#39;re going to be releasing the results of that data so i&amp;#39;m going to defer that question until june but um we will make sure that that gets up on our website and we&amp;#39;ll definitely put it on social media um i am very optimistic uh from what we&amp;#39;ve seen in other areas of the united states um there is no negative impact on your property values by building affordable housing a lot of times they actually go up because as you can se as you can see from these pictures and if you go to irvine irvine has you know a lot of affordable housing that you cannot tell the difference between what are the the regular market rate apartment buildings um and what are the affordable housing so it&amp;#39;s it really is a a myth or a stereotype uh that somehow you know these become you know um you know that they that they become a blight on the community that in some way i mean nothing could be further from the truth because the level of management uh that goes into managing affordable housing is more than you get uh from from a standard apartment building where you know the management is really just there to help you uh you know fix fix your you know leaky your leaky sink right they&amp;#39;re not there providing support um for working families and we know that a lot of the things that um you know are barriers to folks um being independently uh self-sufficient financially are um you know the hardships that come from from having low income from having service sector jobs and children and so the fact that you have an apartment an apartment building apartment complex where there&amp;#39;s services on site to help folks manage it it really does make such a huge difference in the lives of people um so i&amp;#39;m gonna i&amp;#39;m gonna push off the the impact on the surrounding community question until that data comes out but yeah there is there&amp;#39;s been a lot of research on it um there was recently a study released in i think it&amp;#39;s alexandria virginia um and i would encourage you to google that because they did a study that just came out i think in the like the last like two or three months um let me check the time all right we&amp;#39;re almost at an hour um i wonder are there any other questions that folks want to put in the chat um this this question says has have there been conflicts excuse me have there been conflicts between the church&amp;#39;s beliefs and the non-profits that support the services oh the non-profits that provide the services ben you can probably speak to that i would imagine not but uh no there there hasn&amp;#39;t been any conflict or issues with the uh the church&amp;#39;s beliefs and the non-profits um i think it&amp;#39;s a normal standard that um a lot of non-profits their mission is based on their program i mean they don&amp;#39;t talk about religion i think it&amp;#39;s uh i&amp;#39;m sorry i just i don&amp;#39;t have a clear answer for it just because it&amp;#39;s never happened so we&amp;#39;ve never had any issues i i think um if anything they&amp;#39;re more impressed that the fact that you know you know you have organizations like the church that don&amp;#39;t only speak but you know do you know they also walk and they you know take these actions and building affordable housing for families so if anything they&amp;#39;re more impressed than anything else so i&amp;#39;m sorry if that wasn&amp;#39;t the answer you&amp;#39;re looking for but again we just we&amp;#39;ve never had a conflict and it&amp;#39;s not even been brought up but it&amp;#39;s a really good question wayne do you want to speak to that point uh we have never uh had a problem since we&amp;#39;ve opened up since uh wesley village has opened up uh they&amp;#39;re great neighbors and i we feel we&amp;#39;re great never neighbors of them uh we go our way they go their way and uh we really i don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;ve ever had an issue today that&amp;#39;s great that&amp;#39;s great um i don&amp;#39;t see any more questions coming about the project um there was a question of can we find the part one on youtube and i believe you can um if you go to our channel um we&amp;#39;re a chapter of a larger umbi organization called gimbiaction um and i think you can find it on the yinbi action youtube channel but i will make sure to put a link uh to it in the message that goes out um i want to say a huge thank you to jamboree housing and to wayne and garden grove united methodist for participating in this um this is a snapshot of all the things that had to come together to get wesley village uh built but it&amp;#39;s clearly making a difference in the lives of the folks that are living there it&amp;#39;s clearly making a difference in the ability of the church to maintain their property and and keep keep their community their faith community intact um and i would you know i would love to see this on uh i&amp;#39;d love to see us in so many ways put our mission where put our put our money where our mouth is if you would or live out our mission as uh people of faith so i&amp;#39;m very grateful i want to say thank you to providence st joseph&amp;#39;s health uh who has funded our work uh i&amp;#39;d also like to say thank you to skag for the call for collaborations grant which we received which has also helped uh put this together were um the focus of those grants a lot of it has been implementation of housing elements and as as i was saying that uh building affordable housing on faith community land is is a strategy that several cities are in orange county are identifying in their housing element and so we wanted to bring you a snapshot of what is possible and what it would look like um if your community or your faith community or your city uh decided to move it forward so you have any closing thoughts my panelist friends uh i&amp;#39;d like i&amp;#39;d like to make a just a comment since we since uh this has opened we we have received dozens of inquiries from different churches not only in the area but uh across the country i&amp;#39;m talking with peop with a pastor now in north carolina uh there was a group of people that came out from uh central uh uh i think it was nebraska or one of those states there that came out just to see the project so uh it it has gotten a lot of attention from from the faith community and uh we we&amp;#39;ve been very uh happy to share anything we have with them awesome we we did get one last question it was said it&amp;#39;s what do you sort of like what do you wish you knew now like oh sorry what do you wish that you might have done differently knowing what you know now is there anything that you&amp;#39;d address and put in that category any of you i think starting sooner what a great answer no i agree yeah i mean we we need the land so this is all the uh church out there um in temples you know the more people um start and call wayne and his team uh you know we can again we can talk sooner so we need to land that&amp;#39;s great that&amp;#39;s great all right well i&amp;#39;m gonna give you back uh the five minutes of your evening and say a huge thank you for participating in this to jamboree and to wesley village and to garden grove united methodist and with that i will look for my email with the links and i want to thank you all for your time this has

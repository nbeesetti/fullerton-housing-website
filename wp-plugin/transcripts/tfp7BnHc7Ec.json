{"videoId":"tfp7BnHc7Ec","combinedText":"so i&amp;#39;m alice stuffle again and i&amp;#39;m happy to moderate these two panels of speakers today um please note that any one of these speakers or the developers could speak for an hour or two so we are we are um having them all speak for about four minutes but we want to give you a good overview and we want to give you some good resources and people to talk to after this event that you can call upon and maybe you know they can speak at your house of worship so i would like to call all of these people faith and housing heroes um so thank you for being here um as you listen write down any questions that come to you and our moderator of the q&amp;amp;a elizabeth hansburg will go through questions and ask questions at the end of these speakers and the developer panel so i&amp;#39;d like to say first of all um the people we&amp;#39;re going to hear from uh are cesar kovar rubias executive director of the kennedy commission then we&amp;#39;re going to hear from reverend the reverend uh cindy buen um director of st joseph aisal church bua park and then we&amp;#39;ll hear from a few folks at blessed sa ac episcopal church in placentia the reverend r barrett vanen who is the director senior warren warden ned berer and junior warden tom johnson and just so you know i&amp;#39;m gonna have a little thing that says two minutes one minute wrap up all right so please go ahead cesar cy commission sorry thank you uh cesar karas executive director of the cy commission it&amp;#39;s a pleasure to be here with all of you today we are gonna give a quick overview of s sp4 um i think the presentation should move forward with the slides qui that&amp;#39;s not it oh oh you can say next okay yeah ready so i think i want to start off just by acknowledging that as faith leaders churches affordable housing developers you all have been the cutting edge of helping people for many years so we don&amp;#39;t need legislation to tell us how we can help people but it certainly is useful when legislation is codified and it allows you to do your work a little bit easy so we&amp;#39;ll go over that really quickly want to give you a quick overview of sp4 sp4 is new legislation that was just signed by the governor and became in effect this january that would allow for development of housing in um areas where they&amp;#39;re not permitted before so we know that faith-based groups nonprofits have a long history of partnering together to create affordable housing we also know that a lot of uh organizations may have excess land that may not be used to its full potential and we want to repurpose that next slide sorry i can&amp;#39;t see where we&amp;#39;re at issues preventing housing so we know that the issues of prevention of affordable housing um are mostly in the land use side here locally right you may have churches sites that are available they large enough for development but you can&amp;#39;t build housing on them because they&amp;#39;re institutional uses so that&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s been a constant struggle for property owners and partners and we know that resoning those lands is tricky it costs money it costs time and here&amp;#39;s a solution the next slide presents you the information on s4 which is the new legislation that was passed and now allows religious institutions and nonprofit colleges to use uh those sites for housing by right by right means that you&amp;#39;re entitled to be able to build housing without going through any zone changes or any additional requirements at the city level you still have to comply with local jur jurisdiction uh design standards and a variety of other standards that they have locally but they have to be objective um so with the introduction of s4 now there is a possibility of over 171,000 acres of land in california that could open up for development next slide um through s sp4 you also have the ability to not only look at as i mentioned religious sites but also college community college sites that are nonprofits and there&amp;#39;s a variety of other waivers of requirements such as environmental uh quality act reviews that sometimes are stumbling blocks for developments here uh there in order for you to be able to meet those requirements and get those exemptions and the byri development you have to have uh a parcel where housing units will be located within 1,200 uh feet of sites that are currently um were formally involved in any sort of of uh industrial use so you cannot have those close to those sensitive uses right you also have to be at least 160 feet away from those sites that are involving what&amp;#39;s called tital five industrial reuse uh housing also cannot be located with within 3,200 feet of natural gas or refinery so a lot of these are environmental constraints that you would have with other developments so we know that this is going to streamline development but there was also some safeguards for safety next slide the information that we provide is pretty basic but there is more detail to that we&amp;#39;re also available for any information you may want to pursue on this my partner julian will be able to hand out some flyers with more information on the basics of sb4 but also some additional resources by contacting us here the information next slides were pictures of the affordable housing that&amp;#39;s been developed already without sp2 you can quickly go through those but our presenters will be able to elaborate more on them we already have been doing housing on former church sites and that&amp;#39;s the innovation of the affordable housing industry and partnerships but now this will make it a lot easier to be able to streamline that process st joseph&amp;#39;s church got its original plot of land five acres in the late 1950s when episcopal churches in suburbia typically started modestly first worshiping in an allpurpose building but hoping to expand and build a more stately sanctuary and add a k through a school you bought five acres to do this at st joseph&amp;#39;s only the first building which remains as the sanctuary and an office plus sunday school complex came into being the parish sold a portion of the land leaving us an l shaped lot some of which remained literally fellow ground and that empty field abutted the backyards of several houses the people of st joseph&amp;#39;s longed to put the land to holy use and at one point engaged habitat for humanity in hopes that they could build single family homes on the available partion these plans progressed but fell victim to extreme nimbyism the complaint was we don&amp;#39;t want those people living next to us in our dases we&amp;#39;re blessed to have operating a 100y old nonprofit called episcopal communities and services which i believe originally established to provide housing for clergy widows and it grew to build and oversee quality retirement communities in our region my clergy predecessor and a committee of st joseph&amp;#39;s lay people working together with ecs began a relationship with the nonprofit national community renaissance national core for short core developed a plan for a financially self- sustaining 66 unit affordable housing complex for our property to be open to seniors 62 and over and to include up to 13 units of permanent supported housing together core and ecs sponsored community meetings to inform and mify our neighbors and core shephered the project through city approvals and the crucial gathering of funds st joseph&amp;#39;s people attended one planning commission and two council meeting meetings giving prepared talks for which core had coached us we negotiated a 90-year ground lease with core which binds any successors to core to the intent of the project as part of the deal core rebuilt our displaced community orchard planting 34 new much healthier trees in newly prepared ground and we are receiving some compensation for loss of revenue just until the ground lease payments commence because our barn and some rental parking space had to be demolished and assumed under the new project it all came together for a start time late last spring st joseph&amp;#39;s rejoiced in a project that had cleared all the community administrative and financial hurdles and now would be built so now we&amp;#39;re watching the buildings go up as we prepare to meet our new neighbors and think and pray about how to make them welcome we pray for the safety harmony and success of the construction crew and we look forward with joy to full occupancy no later than early next year to all religious organizations contemplating a housing project i recommend prayerful discernment the full participation of your faith community an accurate assessment of the impact on your congregation and campus reliance upon heads wiser than your own where available and faith that god will bring about a good thing right where you are you&amp;#39;re now going to have an opportunity for 12 minutes with blessed sack i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;m father barrett van gan and this is ned berer our senior warden who is going to be sharing how it all began i&amp;#39;m going to explain the whole process of what it took to get where we started the building process and then we have tom tom here will go ahead and share with you he&amp;#39;s our junior warden exactly what it took for the whole building process so we&amp;#39;ll begin with ned thank you father barrett being a good uh listener good person i go back to my undergraduate which i got st ambrose university downport iowa and father bill dun gave me these words of wisdom way back when to create anything your consciousness must pass through three phases move down from the spiritual as inspiration and occurring in your mind is a concept and pictures moving for your mind as motivation and incurring in your body as results and form moving up from your body as completion and being experienced again in the spirit as renewal these three points inspired the vest and the leadership of blessed sacrament to take a hard look at how we were being good stewards of our land we sit on 3.8 acres of land in north orange county and placent uh as we discussed we needed to approve our stewardship of the resources the creator had given us and ideas that were thrown out there was the build a s tower to lease the land to do community gardens put up small houses um 25 years ago this year uh we put a preschool on our campus that now services 70 children from our community then in november of 2016 we were contacted by urban senior housing a berkshire haway unit which is a for-profit company about building senior housings on our campus uh they were in the process of building a retreat center for the brothers of st patrick in midway city and we sat down and talked about it and went up to the bishop and the bishop&amp;#39;s office and talked to them about the idea and they said well wait a minute uh let&amp;#39;s look at this different let&amp;#39;s see if we can find a nonprofit to the people who uh maybe won&amp;#39;t sell the units from out from under you this is one thing we after we read the contract after six months berkshire haway this urban senior housing could have sold these the land lease to another company or another entity so with the help of episcopal community services which cindy mentioned we went through the process of interviewing different developers we had uh national core jambur housing came presented to us and with much discernment much uh discussion uh we decided to use national core so partnership with episcopal community service national core we were able to move forward one of the key questions we ask and i invite all communities to do this does this project facilitate the message and mission of the church backlash gospel are you truly reaching what the gospel is teaching us are we truly doing following the mission of our church because there will be a lot of push back when we move forward with this we had uh members tell us the only reason we were doing it is because we were doing it for the money and we assured them over and over again we&amp;#39;re doing it for the ministry for the mission of housing seniors and in our case we have we&amp;#39;re doing 21 permanent supportive housing which is individuals who are on the street and are now are being housed in hotel rooms for the last two to three months to transition them be able to live in a home uh i&amp;#39;ve talked to homeless people i work down at st paul&amp;#39;s sunday for their their shower ministry and their uh for their sunday supper and a lot of the people who live on the street don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable living inside so they just have to go on so i would urge you to do that to have that discussion see if you&amp;#39;re fulfilling your mission and how it fulfills the gospel brother thank you ned so much if it wasn&amp;#39;t for ned we we wouldn&amp;#39;t be where we are today and it all started with us having communication when i came on board as brand new director almost five years ago next month we had to work together there were a lot of people in the church that were not pleased with the idea of starting a new uh community and so we had the wonderful work of core national core and ecs work together with us to be able to get a design committee established to get interaction going with our community to also work with one of the most challenging moments and that is with our children&amp;#39;s learning center with clc we have a preschool and with that preschool we have 70 students that are coming in on a daily basis and require a a definite uh mindset that took a lot of work and patience to go through a whole construction situation and for national corps it was the first to have a preschool right in the center of a construction center so a lot of work had to be done to work with u with the rules and regulations we all worked together we interconnected and we did that through various meetings lots of great communication where we had the work of also um uh our uh involved as well as everyone involved to make it happen it took a lot of prayer praise and peace because there were a lot of people that had a difficult time saying goodbye to the land that was around them we&amp;#39;re ending up talking about 41 and a half per of our land is dedicated to this project and so it is a ministry it&amp;#39;s not just a project it&amp;#39;s a minister and so we had to all come together to realize what this meant and so we said goodbye to all the land and saying hello to what god has in store so it&amp;#39;s also um open hearts and discernment that it took to make things happen we had to really work together and we did including with the neighborhood we were very ac with the neighborhood in fact the neighborhood had to go ahead and share their viewpoints and national corps was so awesome with the architectural firm they went ahead and they redesigned meeting the specifications of the nebl and then they came back with a new proposal and everyone seemed pretty much on [laughter] board um but what&amp;#39;s exciting is that it was was um all then started and built and that&amp;#39;s where tom johnson comes in our junior um i&amp;#39;m gonna touch base on about five things that each one of you if you have the land if you have you have that one which one uh need to have in the back of your mind uh the community that surrounds your church the community within your church there will be problems from both sides not everybody in the congregation is going to be thrilled about what has happened something&amp;#39;s going to go away something new is something new is going to uh be built um there were many meetings uh when caroline and i came five years ago to blessed sacrament with the community we had to make a design ramifications to meet their desires stay within code make sure that ada all the agencies that go into making this come through uh are taken care of and uh uh we&amp;#39;re on track um the biggest thing i would say is if you go down this road uh it is critical who you pick to do the work there are a number of groups that do this sort of thing had named a couple uh i come with a construction background reper graphics background etc had dealt with some of these people in the past it was fortunate that i was there i feel like god had sent my wife and i there um but the relationship that you establish with the builder with in our case it was national corp it was nightmare of a construction job the children 70 children the amount of fencing that had to be put up taken down moved here moved there the amount of in and out of traffic parents complaining about the safety of the children the smoking that happens on construction site the trash etc all of those things are going to raise the hair on the back of the congregants and the parents and the neighbors but these gentlemen you have to remember and it is a ministry it&amp;#39;s doing god&amp;#39;s work core did back flips for us it&amp;#39;s i&amp;#39;ll give you one simple example you take a look and you start to read construction contract there are terms that are unique in those types of contracts as is unfortunately i think uh st joseph&amp;#39;s found out that as is there&amp;#39;s a water table problem that was unbeknownst to the church to the engineers etc that has to be accommodated that now makes the original plans that you thought you were going to proceed forward the timetable etc it&amp;#39;s changing it now becomes a design build that is conflict with what the parishioners heard what the neighbors heard and what actually can be completed at the end core was great and holding our hands the uh neighbors around our 385 acres and and make that come to fruition uh this project was put back a couple of different times but we are just around the corner uh latest date i had was the 21st of march they&amp;#39;ll be off uh i think the biggest thing is if you have someone in your parish that has some sort of construction background see if you can get them to be part of this project in this ministry it will save headaches for you without question and our grand opening may 13th get it on your [laughter] calendar thank you so much wonderful to hear the faith perspective thank you and you&amp;#39;re doing god&amp;#39;s work and whatever faith you have that&amp;#39;s what we are doing so i invite you to sit down finish your lunch and i&amp;#39;d like to have um the bill builders up please and our builders are alexa wasburn uh she&amp;#39;s from planning and acquisitions with national core renaissance that&amp;#39;s a national core that was mentioned several times alexa is from national corp michael massie chief development officer with jambur housing that was mentioned todd cle who is the principal with cnc development and ed holder who is the vp of real estate development for mercy housing so we&amp;#39;re happy to have you and you can speak in order and make sure that when you speak into the microphone you can even put it closer to you so people on zoom can hear thank you sure well good afternoon again my name is alexa bur i&amp;#39;m senior vice president at national community renaissance and most people call us national core or core for short and uh we are are blessed to be the developer partner for blessed sacrament church as well as st joseph&amp;#39;s episcopal church who you just heard from on the on the faith panel um that&amp;#39;s two of seven church partnerships that we have underway here in southern california and so what i in the short time that i have today what i wanted to share with you is some of the what i feel are key attributes to a successful partnership which have turned into what i would call best practices that i&amp;#39;d like to share and first being that selecting a developer partner that shares your congregation&amp;#39;s priorities uh as explained in the previous panel is majority of our church partners went through a competitive process where they selected us as their developer partner because of our mission alignment and our shared priorities and a real example of that that shows in many different ways um but i believe it&amp;#39;s that shared mission that has made our partnership successful uh one example with blessed sacrament church they had mentioned that um we shared their priority we heard them in terms of their design design when they had been approached by uh the original developer um that that developer had proposed a design that did not place the sanctuary as the central focus we heard early on from the church that that was a priority for them to have that sanctuary remain the central focus of what will be an integrated campus with the with the preschool with the church and the ministry as well as now the senior affordable housing community nestled on campus so we were able to work with them to ensure that the sanctuary made remained the central focus and nestled the senior affordable housing community between two buildings around them another way that that priority shared priorities comes into play is even when we&amp;#39;re structuring the financial portion of of the project um in that many of our faith-based partners wanted remained owners of the land and so we entered into long-term ground leases but we also listened to them in terms of their priorities of did they want a sustainable reoccurring revenue source in terms of a long-term annual ground leas payment or was their need or priority for some upfront payment maybe they had some capital improvements that they needed to do on their campus such as replace a roof or or such and so being able to listen again what the churches and congregations priorities are and how we can meet those by structuring the the financial portion of the project i think secondly and this was touched on is what made a successful partnership is that the church identified a main point of contact and or established a committee right to really lead and guide the process internally and externally um that could be through your what exists as your normal church government structure or in this case with blessed sacrament they selected various members of the congregation volunteered to serve on what was called the design committee to help guide the design of the project but also act as a liaison between the other church congregation and the developer right always displaying and and and being able to communicate um within the congregation think with reverend cindy she was the main point of contact for st j episcopal church but we also i wanted to point out doug gillan who is here today with santa ana united methodist church who was my main point of contact had a construction background similar to tom that really led that redevelopment process of what is legacy square in downtown san ana and then lastly i know i&amp;#39;m wrapping it up is uh the community outreach piece is ensuring that there is a robust multi-tiered community outreach and engagement program starting internally within the church right we you know there may be some leaders but also getting the rest of the congregation supportive then working outwardly with your city your city partner city staff elected officials but more importantly your surrounding community and once you can educate and train really the church congregation then they can act as cheerleaders and champions for the housing within the surrounding community um so the best case going forward is i encourage you to reach out to the to representatives from the panel before you other church partners that have had successful uh church partnerships and and have been able to implement affordable housing go to a tour go tour some of these affordable housing communities that you&amp;#39;re going to hear about from the panel today thank you good afternoon uh i&amp;#39;m ed holder with mercy housing california uh i&amp;#39;m our vice president of real estate development uh we are just about there um that was a great summary i mean that there there&amp;#39;s a few things that you know i might add but that really i think encapsulates how uh how you want to want to approach it and how we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve approached our work uh just a little bit of background on mercy um so we&amp;#39;re a national non for-profit organization we&amp;#39;re founded by the sisters of mercy about 40 years ago and actually just on one of the slides one of our one our f first faith-based uh partnerships was in the early 90s uh up in da city we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re a national organization we worked statewide in california and it was with um it was what&amp;#39;s called a hud 202 um and the cost per unit for those of you who are just interested in history the cost per unit was $80,000 for the entire unit so just for a little house you could you could pay for a bedroom and like maybe half of a bathroom right now um but uh but the challenges i think one of the biggest challenges we face um uh right now at this moment is around funding and uh this is a great time to be planning what what we&amp;#39;re doing but i just in in your role and work as faith leaders um i just would put a plug in for the reality of the state budget situation right now which is pretty dire for new construction i just i just have to say that this is a great time to be planning but the budget as it stands right now pretty much guts new construction for at least this year and maybe maybe next year and it&amp;#39;s even climbed back to some older projects so this is not a scare tactic but it is a look this is a great time to be planning but also you know call your local representatives to underscore the importance of new production in your community because ironically we&amp;#39;ve never been at an easier i say easier none of this is easy but relatively speaking an easier time getting new housing approved between s sp4 and some other state expediting measures land owners and sell have there&amp;#39;s a lot of path forward where you&amp;#39;re not getting lies aren&amp;#39;t shutting you down but the challenge is we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve arguably not had a more challenging uh state budget situation at least not since redevelopment went away for those of you who track that you know more than 10 years ago so anyway um moving on so mercy housing uh national organization uh secular despite despite our founding and a lot of history of of partnering with uh with faith uh organizations and and um and cities and counties around the state um can move to the currently own and manage thank you um one of the questions you you faced early on and was was touched on is who is going to going to live there and we f we find and found as come to the campus here in a moment but that that was one of our biggest challenges or consistently is one of our bigger challenges is finding a population mix that everybody understands and you can articulate and supportive housing is is really critical in many of our communities but but it also entails a lot of education around operations and what is the property going to look like once it&amp;#39;s built and that&amp;#39;s where many of our questions um surface so construction is hard and you you&amp;#39;ve heard why it&amp;#39;s really hard um but then once you get through how&amp;#39;s it going to be set up for long long-term success so understand understanding um parking mechanics and drop off and and services and really getting to that past the the the immediate past the next three years what is what does year 4 through 20 look like and how are you setting the property and the operations the finances up for long-term success if we go to the via st joseph slide um welcome to do a tour anytime i don&amp;#39;t know that we can do one necessarily today but just to my left uh we are redeveloping um the mother house into senior apartments it&amp;#39;s an adaptive reuse um those are always you know challenging and so much communication and thanks to uh sister diane and the sister community here more broadly navigating many of the logistics around parking etc and switch gear electrical delays i mean it nothing goes as you&amp;#39;ve planned right that&amp;#39;s one thing to know nothing will go as you you planned so that partnership and communication is is really really critical and has led to what will be uh 50 beautiful new homes uh finished in the next several months um and then last uh last slide or the yep that one just to touch on there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a variety of ways that you can partner right um might have excess land we we&amp;#39; bought land you know from churches that we&amp;#39;re looking to relocate just completely and move to a different a different setting long-term ground leases which we&amp;#39;ve done uh number of settings but with a community in cola up in the bay area uh with the arch dases up there long-term ground lease so the the arch dases maintains ownership um can create some challenges with some of our funders but we can work through that um so we know that ownership is often one of the one of the more critical elements so um i think defining what your goals are from the beginning uh and being really clear on those goals and and trying to simplify them and being clear with your partners about the approval process that&amp;#39;s one of the in terms of places where we&amp;#39;ve gotten tripped up before and things get slowed down what are the levels of approval because sometimes it can get quite complicated to be clear on what those stepar really hi good afternoon my name is michael massie excuse me i am the chief development officer of jambur jamber is a 501c3 nonprofit affordable housing developer i always have one note when i when i do any sort of public speaking that i tell people about myself i&amp;#39;m g to add two more today for a reason but uh first of all i talk really really fast uh so i apologize but i&amp;#39;m available for i&amp;#39;ll stay as long as you like for questions and answers afterwards because i&amp;#39;m a much better conversationalist than i am a public speaker um two other notes i i do want to add this afternoon one um uh in the vernacular i i grew up as a as a pk as a pastor&amp;#39;s kid my father was a congregationalist minister who then 12 months after he retired was uh confirmed baptized uh and and received communion in the catholic church so i come from a very ecumenical background so i&amp;#39;m very comfortable in the room today um and thirdly ned um i i i i i hate losing out ever and i i guess i don&amp;#39;t mind losing out the national core but i grew up in molen illinois like half my family are are st ambrose bees if we&amp;#39;d known that we could have done something at any rate um all the all the folks here at at the panel to are very very respons developers and i i will say a lot of good things about them not out loud but i will say a lot of good things about them um and a lot of what i&amp;#39;m going to say a lot of what i&amp;#39;m going to cover alexa and ed have already covered and you&amp;#39;re going to hear some similar themes uh they&amp;#39;re about partnership they&amp;#39;re about honesty they&amp;#39;re about transparency they&amp;#39;re about making sure that you understand um what it is the deal that you&amp;#39;re getting into i want to stress and underline that what we do is extraordinarily complex and i don&amp;#39;t say that with any sort of false pride this is the the the most complex real estate transaction that&amp;#39;s done on a regular basis it&amp;#39;s everything that&amp;#39;s hard about building market rate housing plus you have a whole lot of government involvement and seven layers of financing so these are enormously complex projects they they are very dynamic they change throughout the development process um and and that will have an impact on uh on on uh the economics of the deal and and ultimately who&amp;#39;s living there and what&amp;#39;s what is actually built so choose your partner carefully understand what it is that what their mission is what their priorities are and be as as candid as you can about that uh the successful uh church project that we did was in garden grove with garden grove united methodist church and it was a very long conversation it was a it was two years of talking and getting to know each other before we we moved forward and started composing anything um the it&amp;#39;s a very familiar story garden gr united methodist church has been there for decades was facing a reduced congregation and an enormous amount of parking uh they wanted to uh provide community benefit and part of the congregation felt we needed to provide housing for uh for working families and other part of the congregation thought we wanted to serve seniors um and on this uh this vacant land we said well we can do both so again know who your partner is with and this was kind of a creative solution that we came up with so we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re we have one building that is reserved for seniors another building that is reserved for for families but for funding purposes that qualifies as a family project um senior projects are harder to get financed so this was a way for us to be able to get the deal finan and kind of serve both those those masters um the other uh priorities are obviously the church while wanting to be a strong community member and provide a community benefit wanted to realize some economic gain for that as alexa talked about it&amp;#39;s like well what does that look like what does that mean and it turned out what was very important to them was an ongoing consistent dependable stream of of income from from a ground laas payment and that&amp;#39;s great we thought we we we could make that work but there&amp;#39;s a problem early in these projects they don&amp;#39;t cash flow very well there&amp;#39;s not a lot of cash available so but we knew how important that was to the to the church so we established and capitalized a reserve for the first five years of the lease to make sure that those payments would be there until ultimately the increased cash flow kicked in five years later when i talk about complex this is what i mean this is one of a thousand different facets that you have to to think about and and and work with as you&amp;#39;re working through these projects but we knew that this was a priority for the for the church and we work with that um what we ultimately built in addition to uh a senior serving building and a family serving building we also brought in additional community partners so alzheimer&amp;#39;s orange um the boys and girls club uh we built a community space for them to to work with on our project um in addition to uh to the the residential uses um again this was this matched the church&amp;#39;s mission matched jamber mission to provide community benefit um throughout the throughout the whole lastly um and this is a bit of personal pride uh we won a gold nugget for this for this project which is was very highly coveted for me at the time it&amp;#39;s a a it&amp;#39;s a design award given by the pacific coast builders conference um but we were very proud of that this was something that that again we knew was important to the church that this fit in with the community and was a jewel for the community an asset to the community and raised up the level of the community in addition to serving the residents there it was a priority for the church was a priority for chambar and something that we delivered um again i talk really fast but i&amp;#39;m around to to answer questions for as long as you like [applause] good afternoon my name is todd coddle i&amp;#39;m a principal with cnc development appreciate being included today uh cnc development and i&amp;#39;m gonna like michael probably go pretty quick i have a few more slides to make sure i get through them uh cnc development&amp;#39;s been in the development business of affordable housing for over 30 years we self perform on our property management we&amp;#39;ve never sold a community that we develop we like to tell our partners whether it&amp;#39;s a local city whether it&amp;#39;s a church that we&amp;#39;re working with when you get us you get us for life you get us for the long term so we make decisions relative to design to ownership to operations for the long term and with the longterm in mind move on to the next slide please and the slide after that please cnc development&amp;#39;s been developing in the city of orange almost going back to our inception and and because we are here in the city of orange we&amp;#39;re going to talk briefly about two projects that we&amp;#39;re doing in conjunction or have done in conjunction with local churches if you could move on next please uh cnc development these are a sample of some of our developments here in the city of orange the development in the bottom right hand corner finishing up here in about a week or hopefully two weeks i think one of the themes we heard is getting uh edison to come out and install our meters and other stuff so as long as edison shows up within the next week we should be moving residents in in a couple weeks if we can move on to the next two slides please uh the first uh partnership was with orangeville bible church and this was done a few years back by the mall of orange for folks familiar with the city over off of beats if you can move to the next slide please partnered with the orangeville bible church to redevelop about two and a half acres of of their site got together with the congregation at that that point in time met with their elders met with their session talked to them really about what their needs were came to the conclusion ultimately the church had a a need for an inf influx of of new capital they actually sold a portion of the property but really designed this site and working in conjunction with the other examples we&amp;#39;ve seen here today to work in operation in conjunction with the existing church which is the goal for the existing church to to stay in its current location maybe change how it&amp;#39;s utilized in its property out there orangeville bible church if you could move on to the next slide please um served and had a strong local community outreach within this neighborhood in the city of orange one of the more challenging neighborhoods we got together with the congregation said how can we bring an influx of capital into your existing congregation your existing church help to rehabilitate the church provide for additional open space for the church that was actually programmed a little bit more formally and then provide for additional community space which can be used within our affordable development but also with the church on sundays on evenings and then really kind of lift up the local outreach that they were doing within this portion of the city of orange and if you could slip two slides forward please we&amp;#39;ve got some photos of the development one more please uh and laid it out where we have more heavily programmed open space but also laid out to where we have a joint use facility that the church can use on sunday there&amp;#39;s rollway gates that they can use for their their coffee after church services a community center building that we use that provides not only social services for our residents but can meet the needs of the church after hours on sundays as well you can scroll forward please and then the second one i wanted to talk to and it&amp;#39;s really thinking outside the box as we get together with churches and congregations and meet and really put ourselves in their shoes what are their needs at any given point in time as i mentioned with orangeville bible church it was actually purchasing a portion of their property which which allowed the church to remain in its current location they had gone through a congregation split previously prior to interacting and and reaching out to them um to to another example which is even a little bit more outside the box of what we&amp;#39;re talking about today but thought it would be interesting to mention because not all churches what we found in the past are actually housing sites depending upon the local um uh restrictions around the area that it&amp;#39;s in the land size of what we have and so we&amp;#39;re about halfway through a partnership with first presbyterian church of the city of orange folks are familiar with it right downtown one of the five original church congregations here in the city of orange if you can move on to the next slide um the the portion of the properties that are actually highlighted there were all at one point in time or owned by the first presbyterian church we have since bought the building on the bottom it was a 1940s ymca ywca so if anybody went to the local y here in the city of orange that&amp;#39;s the building that you could remember going to as a child bought that from the church which allowed them actually to pay off some existing debt that they had that were having a little bit more difficulty in servicing converted that over to an event wedding facility which has been very successful not only for for the church but for the downtown orange area and then we are pulling building permits this week on the the portion of the blue in the the upper leftand corner said 20,000 square foot was the original a portion of it was the original church sanctuary that dates back to the early 20s 1920s that work currently going through right now if anybody&amp;#39;s driven by it over the last few weeks it&amp;#39;s all just wood framing uh it&amp;#39;s not technically historical but it&amp;#39;s in that age era it would be significantly cheaper and significantly easier if we could tear down the building but that&amp;#39;s not what we&amp;#39;re doing we&amp;#39;re repurposing it into a 20,000 foot mixed use facility which is actually bringing in reoccurring revenue for the congregation so uh and this is really just highlighting you know housing&amp;#39;s not a fit although housing&amp;#39;s our goal and housing&amp;#39;s everybody&amp;#39;s up here goal but it&amp;#39;s really trying to come up with creative solutions to meet the needs of the local congregation and the local church if you could just scroll through the the next few slides briefly this is the the building that&amp;#39;s being repurposed into mix use uh the next two slides after this and one more and this just a facility or pictures of the facility that were repurposed into a wedding event center which is interesting with certain congregations some of the size that that churches have of of space that sometimes goes underutilized as well during other portions of the week so with that would like to thank you for [applause] being all right thank you so much um can we have the other um uh speakers up including cesar we have [music] sh and at this time when you as you come up i&amp;#39;d like to present to you elizabeth hansburg from people for housing and along with elizabeth cesar and lisa sna um they were like the subcommittee that planned this event which is great so that&amp;#39;s wonderful okay so at this time can i have a couple of the volunteers collect any of the questions from the tables if you have any questions from your tables can you raise your hands hold them up okay great and then we&amp;#39;ll have and then if you can give those to elizabeth all right so elizabeth is going to take it from here and do the question and answer we&amp;#39;ll have about 15 minutes okay good afternoon everybody i&amp;#39;m elizabeth with people for housing um i just want to say thank you to everybody who came today to tell your story about how we built more affordable housing in orange county um it&amp;#39;s daunting there&amp;#39;s no question that this is uh these are big problems excuse me that we&amp;#39;re trying to solve but we know that with man things can be impossible with god all things are possible so want to just lean into the opportunity that we have here um with with all of the potential land that exists between our common congregations and go forward in hope that we will build more housing for the most vulnerable members of our community so with that if anybody has questions so far i&amp;#39;ve only got two um but please feel free to pass them up oh online okay okay great do you have a okay oh awesome okay perfect all right as old age has come to me i have to put on my reading glasses so this says hi i&amp;#39;m actually i know about that one so i&amp;#39;m gonna save that one to the end okay um it says there are tax credits for construction how how do you finance affordable housing on an ongoing basis looking at my developer friends over here you don&amp;#39;t now there our our goal when we underwrite these is that they are self-supported so one so they&amp;#39;re subsidized only on a capital basis so all the funding comes in up front and then they&amp;#39;re designed and and underwritten to operate strictly on the lower rents as revenue to operate uh for the next 55 years okay does that include money for social services why do you have to complicate it i&amp;#39;m sorry i good good clean simple answer um no so so if you&amp;#39;re talking about permanent supportive housing housing for folks with special needs oftentimes there is additional funding required for that there there are many different ways that you can fund that one of the ways that we use often is by using project based vouchers okay again so if you have the commitment for vouch at the very beginning you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about that sub okay anybody else want to weigh in on that among my developer friends so i&amp;#39;ll just say that i am not a housing finance expert but i liken it to the seven layer cake or trifle or lasagna there are multiple layers that go into it and so when i think it was michael said the most complex deal in real estate he wasn&amp;#39;t joking but we have partners and leaders that can walk you through it so thank you for that okay next question it sounds like most people are building quote unquote affordable housing for seniors i can&amp;#39;t read this same how are we as okay is this a how how how are we as faith-based organizations building housing for homeless single men to what is that today well how are we building housing for homeless so looking at that specific population which i think they&amp;#39;re getting at a psh population for for men any you can answer that okay great hi my name is lisa cerna i am from flying des first nations 36 territory in um saskatchewan canada i&amp;#39;me um i just recently helped i&amp;#39;m sorry she is yeah i am oh okay like this can you hear it all right all right again my name is lisa cerna um so right now with the housing um what is happening is they have to call 211 and then from there they get they are assigned um a case worker and they go on to a list and generally what they do is they wait about one year and so these are single men that have uh been homeless for over a year which means that they&amp;#39;re not couch surfing that they&amp;#39;re not uh put up in hotels or that they they&amp;#39;re not in cars they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re strictly homeless and then so from there uh what they do is after the year if they&amp;#39;re lucky pretty much then they move into a hotel they get the voucher for the hotel they get the voucher for the hotel i believe for up to three months and then after the three months then uh if an affordable housing unit becomes available then they get placed in the uh the housing unit so that&amp;#39;s i think that&amp;#39;s great that&amp;#39;s like the pathway that the person goes through to get placed in housing but i think what this question is actually getting at is how do we build for that subpopulation sure and i can help answer that is i know the a lot of many of the examples that you heard today were uh were age restricted senior affordable housing but really there is a spectrum of housing being built with our church partners it&amp;#39;s primarily um what the priority is for that specific church in terms of the target population that they want to serve uh so we do have for example uh the partnership with the santa ana united methodist church at legacy square you know they have been serving the downtown san anam community for over a hundred years and serving families so their target population their priority population that they wanted to serve was families and so legacy squ uh contains a mix of one bedroom two bedroom and three bedroom apartment homes you know for single individual households as well as families um another instance is down in san diego our partnership with uh nester united methodist church that project is an entirely 100% permanent supportive housing meaning it&amp;#39;s all you know one bedrooms or studios um that particular congregation uh chose to prioritize and want to serve individuals who are homeless or at risk of being homeless and so we were able to design a project so i think any of the developers here are qualified well respected and would work with the church congregations right to build and finance a community for a target population that you want to serve so that there are developments underway out there we just maybe didn&amp;#39;t highlight them today okay great yeah um and m michael touched on this as well i think with the senior family mix many of the communities now are actually uh mixed population so so it might be family with a set aside um our senior community here has a set aside about a third of the units will be for formally um homeless seniors so finding that mix is often the way that both meets multiple needs of of a congregation meets the financing needs because it&amp;#39;s very complicated to line up the financing and in some cases often times 100 100% perit supportive housing brings on the services and other challenges that can can be can be and ar increasingly more difficult to operate in this environment and so finding mixed populations is is something to consider so then kind of everybody wins as well and it of ends up being a more um balanced community great um this question i think is actually getting a kind of an elaboration on the financing so okay okay um so this one says this i think this would be a good claim debt service it says what will the rent be and will all the rent go to the builder and i i know the answer to that question cl says no the rent will go to pay the debt service but that&amp;#39;s as much as i know so you take it from here um so yeah the the the rents as they&amp;#39;re paid we refer to as the cash flow from from the operations after you pay all your expenses you get down to your cash flow we&amp;#39;re looking at a development initially and and what michael was sharing is we&amp;#39;re really underwriting these projects upfront to be sustainable over the long term so we calculate what the debt service would be which is the same as somebody&amp;#39;s first trust eed on their home that rent payments go then to pay that first trusteed and then depending upon the mix depending upon the funding sources this can get um very widely but if you would have say a ground le scenario a portion then of that money is also going to pay your ground leas or let&amp;#39;s say you didn&amp;#39;t have a ground lease and similar to our example that i gave with orangeville bible we purchased the property well in order to purchase the property we had to borrow money from the city of orange and so a portion of that cash flow that residual cash flow is going to actually pay back the local city over a long period of time sometimes up to 55 years to pay back those other funding sources that you have which could be the city the county the state uh private organizations there&amp;#39;s a lot of as elizabeth was saying it is a layer cake of financing that we have to bring together to make these projects come to question awesome thank you go ahead yes ruben online asks i believe it was michael who mentioned that senior housing projects are more difficult to get financing why is that because more cities would rather house seniors than pay for parks in schools and libraries for kids to use is the short and cynical answer uh it&amp;#39;s easy it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s pol politically easier to get senior housing built so the funding sources prioritize family housing that each of the funding sources has various priorities that they want to serve sometimes it&amp;#39;s families sometimes it&amp;#39;s people coming from homelessness sometimes it&amp;#39;s certain geographic areas but there but there are priorities and all the funding sources we have to compete for these are scarce resources that we apply for and compete for against each other yeah and every other project in california or in the county so the each of the funding sources sets their priorities often times uh because cities will support the development of senior housing then the state funding sources or federal funding sources say okay then we have to prioritize family uh family housing so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s constantly weighing those different priorities of all the different funding sources and with this layer cake each of these seven layers we have to make sure each of those seven work together and and oftentimes they have competing requirements and restrictions balance ing that is kind of is why this is very complex and then last one that i have in my hand before uh i think somebody wants to share an event um can you talk about how you set the rents or how the rents are set because i mean really you are assembling the land labor in capital to bring these housing units online to put roofs over people&amp;#39;s heads but at the end of the day it&amp;#39;s not like you&amp;#39;re choosing the rent so can you give a little bit of background on how how that gets set okay to add to the theme of complexity our rents are set by our funding sources is probably the simplest way to answer it the state who we all go to for tax credits will have their own financing requirements of where our rents need to be set when i say rents it&amp;#39;s a variety of rents sometimes four to five different rents for each bedroom type that you have and then across your bedroom type so four let&amp;#39;s say you have one two and three bedrooms four different rent types you have 12 different rents within your building at any given time those rents change every year on an annual basis based upon county median income so for orange county to riverside county that changes on an annual basis and then to further add to the complexity is that may be what the requirements are for the state but the working with say the local city or working through state density b bonus law or working through other uh financing tools and and entitlement tools you get an even further lay of complexity around your rents but there set based upon county median income is really kind of the base answer and then that changes on an annual basis okay great yeah so we had one last question um so she&amp;#39;s asking i think and hard for me to because i know the answer so i wanted to say it but so the question is when you build your apartment buildings are all the units below market rate right are they all affordable versus i think other types of development that have like a percentage in theory no you can do mixed income um and in fact the the low-income housing tax credit program was designed to do that a lot of the other funding sources were in practice it&amp;#39;s very difficult to do market rate housing mixed with with affordable housing for a number of reasons but we&amp;#39;re certainly open to to doing that and i think quite frankly in the future that will be the future of affordable housing it&amp;#39;s mixed income okay awesome and i guess we have one more from the chat yes ask uh are there any restrictions in sp sp4 as to the level of affordability required and requirements for how long sustain [music] okay the the developments are geared for 100% affordable developments um and so the affordability would be at low and very low just to define that in orange county that&amp;#39;s probably uh making anywhere from 30,000 or no income to about 70,000 is that correct for family for for family for okay i think that&amp;#39;s actually a great segue because the real question here is how do we move it forward we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve had a conversation we know it&amp;#39;s hard to do we&amp;#39;re hoping that there&amp;#39;s still interest in moving this forward so for next steps we&amp;#39;re going to turn it over to cesar um sorry oh actually here great well thank you everybody for participating and uh making contributions to this great discussion i think our intent was to ensure we had a forum where we could provide partnerships and and some answers as to how to get started but we had a lot of great information today about where to start those conversations and that&amp;#39;s what it has to be a conversation where you talk to your community you talk to your congregation make decisions on assets and then find those partnerships and start asking those questions i think a lot of us here in the room are available for you to be able to have that initial dialogue elizabeth is a good source cy commission is a good source the developers are a good source other organizations other uh congregations that have gone through this process or an excellent source uh if you need more information than that or you need some guidance or technical support you can also come to us and we&amp;#39;ll be able to connect you with partners who may have architects partners who may have development partners uh to answer those specific questions because not every parcel not every property is the same and there&amp;#39;s going to be constraints there&amp;#39;s going to be even though we have byright development everybody thinks that that&amp;#39;s that means that we&amp;#39;re going to be able to do whatever we want it doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it means that you have an ability to move forward quicker and through a process that should be less restrictive but
